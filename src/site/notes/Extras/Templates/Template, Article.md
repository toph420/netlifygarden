> [!Ava]- AI Highlight Analysis
> Take a look at all of my highlights, denoted here by unique ids. Ignore the single word highlights, some contain definitions below them, those can be combined in a "Words" list with definitions of each which we will do later. Given the other highlights, and the personal notes I made below them for some of them, give me a short essay describing the themes of the article, use quotes from the highlights and include outside sources if you find it helpful.
