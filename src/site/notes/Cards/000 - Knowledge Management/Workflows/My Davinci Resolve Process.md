# My Davinci Resolve Process

> [!Abstract]- My Process
> 1. Use Post Haste to create a new project folder structure (use my Davinci template)
> 2. Drag video files/folders into the Media -> Video folder (this changes for project for me, I try to keep them similar to the folder name, but sometimes you film interviews and b-roll
> on the same card etc)
> 3. In the Edit page, drag the project folders onto the word "Master" in the left sidebar, this will create project bins (I like to colorize mine)
> 4. Add a few more bins and timelines like so to get started (Add a bin by right clicking Master and clicking "Create new bin")
> 	1. 1.0 Timelines
> 		1. Master
> 			1. Master v1.0 (new timeline, I typically duplicate the timeline and rename it v1.x each time i go back through my selects, for each client revision I up the version to x.0)
> 		2. Selects
> 		3. B-Roll
> 			1. Selects 01 - B-Roll - Ronin (new timeline)
> 			2. Selects 01 - B-Roll - Handheld (new timeline)
> 		4. Interviews
> 			1. Selects 01 - Name
> 5. To start sifting through the footage:
> 	1. First, install my keyboard shortcuts via Davinci Resolve -> Keyboard customization -> click the 3 dots in the top right -> import preset- > open the .txt file
> 	2. Now, separate your video files into new folders of your liking within the "1.1 Video" folder ie separate interviews from b-roll similar to the timeline folder structure
> 	3. Open a timeline you'd like to begin adding sorted clips to, ie "Selects 01 - B-Roll - Ronin"
> 	4. Then click on the title of the corresponding folder of clips ie "Day 1 - Ronin"
> 	5. Now go to the "Cut" page (bottom nav bar left of the edit page)
> 	6. Click on the "Source Tape" button (its a tiny button in the top left of the video viewer" (this is an awesome button, it shows all clips in a particular folder as if it was one long clip)
> 	7. Use "j, k, l" keys to navigate forward and backward thru the footage
> 		1. hold "k" and click "j" or "l" to move the playhead one frame forward/back
> 		2. double tap "j" or "l" to increase speed of playback (good for slomo clips)
> 	8. Use "i" and "o" to select in and out points
> 	9. Use "p" to append the clip to the end of the timeline
> 	10. Continue through all the clips and you'll end up with a timeline full good shit
> 6. After doing the above process for all of your video folders, start again in the "Edit" page
> 	1. Version the first Selects timeline by duplicating and renaming to Selects 02 - xxxx
> 	2. In the selects timeline use a similar strategy to cull this version except this time it's a bit different than using the "source tape" method. Use "j, k, l" again, but this time use "q" and "w" to "trim start" and "trim end" to fine tune clips. This will delete anything before the playhead or after the playhead on the current clip.
> 	3. At this stage I will continue to widdle the clips down, only keeping the best (I still have my original selects in Selects 01 versions)
> 	4. I like to color code the clips as I go, using lime green as top, yellow as medium. Or I'll color code them by type of clip (establishing, closeup, interior, etc), person, topic, etc.
> 7. Once you have a bunch of Selects timelines you can start editing
> 	1. Open your Master v1.0 timeline and click the button with the "+" sign in the top right, this will create stacked timelines.
> 	2. Open your Selects timelines in the top or bottom and your Master in the other
> 	3. You're READY TO ROCK!
> 8. color code your clips and tracks, it helps so much!
> 9. use the subtitle track to add easily readable descriptions of sections of your video or make notes

> # Creating a New Project Folder Structure
> 
> Using Post Haste, create a new project folder structure using the Davinci template.
> 
> # Dragging in Video Files
> 
> Drag desired video files/folders into the `Media -> Video` folder.
> 
> # Setting Up Project Bins
> 
> On the `Edit` page, drag the project folders onto the word "Master" in the left sidebar to create project bins. Add a few bins and timelines as listed below:
> 
> 1.0 Timelines
> - Master
> - Master v1.0
> - Selects
> - B-Roll
> - Selects 01 - B-Roll - Ronin
> - Selects 01 - B-Roll - Handheld
> - Interviews
> - Selects 01 - Name
> 
> # Sifting Through the Footage
> 
> Install keyboard shortcuts via Davinci Resolve -> Keyboard customization -> click the 3 dots in the top right -> import preset- > open the `.txt` file. Separate video files into folders within the "1.1 Video" folder, organize interviews from B-Roll and similar to the timeline folder structure.
> 
> # Adding Clips to the Timeline
> 
> Open a timeline you'd like to begin adding clips to, i.e. `Selects 01 - B-Roll - Ronin`. Click on the title of the corresponding folder of clips. Go to the "Cut" page (bottom nav bar left of the edit page). Click on the "Source Tape" button (in the top left of the video viewer). Use `j, k, l`, `i` and `o`, and `p` to navigate, select in and out points, and append clips to the end of the timeline.
> 
> # Versioning
> Duplicate and rename the first Selects timeline to `Selects 02 - xxxx`. In the selects timeline use `j, k, l`, and `q` and `w` to trim start and trim end clips to fine tune.
> 
> # Editing 
> Open the `Master v1.0` timeline and click the button with the `+` sign in the top right to create stacked timelines. Open Selects timelines in the top or bottom and your Master in the other. Color code clips and tracks. Use the subtitle track to add easily readable descriptions of sections of the video or make notes.

> [!ava]- Process v2
> 1. **Initial Setup**
>     
>     - Use Post Haste to create a new project folder structure using my Davinci template.
>     - Drag video files/folders into the `Media -> Video` folder. Note that the organization might vary per project. Aim for names similar to the folder, but adjustments might be necessary for things like interviews and b-roll shot on the same card.
> 2. **Organizing in Davinci Resolve**
>     
>     - In the Edit page, drag project folders onto the word "Master" in the left sidebar to create project bins. (I like to colorize mine for easier identification.)
>     - Add additional bins and timelines as follows (Add a bin by right-clicking "Master" and selecting "Create new bin"):
>         - **1.0 Timelines**
>             - Master
>             - Master v1.0 (Duplicate and rename the timeline for each revision, incrementing the version for client revisions.)
>             - Selects
>             - B-Roll
>                 - Selects 01 - B-Roll - Ronin
>                 - Selects 01 - B-Roll - Handheld
>             - Interviews
>                 - Selects 01 - Name
> 3. **Sifting Through Footage**
>     
>     - Install my keyboard shortcuts via `Davinci Resolve -> Keyboard customization`, click the 3 dots in the top right, then import the preset from the .txt file.
>     - Organize your video files into new folders within the "1.1 Video" folder, e.g., separate interviews from b-roll, mirroring the timeline structure.
>     - Open a timeline you'd like to begin adding clips to, e.g., "Selects 01 - B-Roll - Ronin".
>     - Click on the title of the corresponding folder of clips, e.g., "Day 1 - Ronin".
>     - Go to the "Cut" page and click on the "Source Tape" button to view all clips in a folder as one continuous clip.
>     - Use "j, k, l" keys for navigation, "i" and "o" to set in and out points, and "p" to append clips to the timeline.
>     - Continue this process for all video folders.
> 4. **Refining Selects**
>     
>     - Version the first Selects timeline by duplicating and renaming (e.g., to Selects 02 - xxxx).
>     - Use "j, k, l" for playback, and "q" and "w" for trimming the start and end of clips.
>     - Color code clips for priority or type (e.g., lime green for top clips, yellow for medium, or by type/person/topic).
> 5. **Editing**
>     
>     - Open your Master v1.0 timeline and create stacked timelines by clicking the "+" sign.
>     - Open your Selects timelines on the top or bottom, with your Master in the other.
>     - You're ready to start editing.
>     - Color code your clips and tracks for better organization.
>     - Use the subtitle track to add descriptions or notes about sections of your video.
