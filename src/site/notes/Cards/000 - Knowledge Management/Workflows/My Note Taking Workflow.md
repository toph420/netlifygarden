# My Note Taking Workflow

> I do a whole lot of reading and watching and listening and logging, here's a my workflow for getting all those things into my second brain, called [[Atlas/游 Sid\|游 Sid]]. 

## Notes in [[Atlas/游 Sid\|游 Sid]]
-   Household management (shopping lists, chores, etc.)
-   Task management
-   Various kinds of annotations
-   Shared work notes (meeting minutes, documentation, etc.)
-   Personal work notes
-   Idea exploration
-   Journalling
-   Scrapbooking (digital and analogue)
-   Research management
-   Information management (bookmarks and the like)
-   Project management and support notes
-   Client management
-   Concept database

## Process
1. Create a new note using [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Plugin - Templater\|Templater]] and [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Plugin - Quickadd\|Quickadd]], easy access through [[Cards/000 - Knowledge Management/My Hotkeys\|My Hotkeys]]
2. Set the `status` for either `游닌` or `游닇`
3. See [[Cards/000 - Knowledge Management/My Meta\|My Meta]] for more details about status and tags.

## Status

### Status for All Notes (游닇)
> This status is given to any note that's written in my own words
- `#游닇/游` Incubator/Needs Work
- `#游닇/游꺔` Sprout/Keep Working
- `#游닇/游` Sapling/Final Push
- `#游닇/游` Evergreen/Completed-ish

### Status for All Sources (游닌)
> This status is used to categorize all of my highlights from external sources. Notes that spawn from these highlights will have a regular note status to distinguish anything that's not my own words. 
-   `#游닌/游린勇`Not Processed
-   `#游닌/游릲勇勇`Processing
-   `#游닌/游릳`Synthesizing
-   `#游닌/游릴` Completed

## Notes
- [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Tools + Plugins\|Tools + Plugins]] are categorized as [[Atlas/游닌 Sources\|游닌 Sources]] since their content is mostly external 
- Any newly spawned atomic notes will link back to the original source, but now embedded in a new note with my own annotations recognized as a sapling 游, the note must be fully annotated and linked to become an evergreen 游 note in my cards.
- Kanban board for sources and status

> [!ABSTRACT] Christian's Sources
> For sources I am mostly using [Christian B. B. Houmann's Guide to Importing Sources](https://bagerbach.com/blog/importing-source-notes-to-obsidian). 
> See: [Issues 췅 chhoumann/quickadd 췅 GitHub](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/issues)
> - **Books**I read on my iPad, from which I send the notes from [[Kindle\|Kindle]] to[[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Readwise Reader\|Readwise Reader]]
> - **Articles**I read on their respective webpages. On the page, I useReader맚o write notes. These are synchronized to Readwise, and then I manually choose to add these to my vault.
> - **Tweets**Same as articles
> - **YouTube videos**I use a template in Obsidian along with the[Media Extended](https://github.com/aidenlx/media-extended)맗lugin to write notes with timestamps. For importing videos I use the Quickadd command "Add Youtube Video", make sure the video URL is copied to clipboard, and then copy the related highlights from Readwise along with other related info.
> - **Podcast episodes**I've made a plugin called[PodNotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGLfuN15uJY) that helps you write notes on podcasts. This is much faster and more reliable (in my opinion) than other services. Check that out instead! Instructions in this post will follow my previous workflow, so you can choose whichever fits you best.
>> I have an option here, either listen to the podcast in Obsidian and take notes directly OR use [[Snipd\|Snipd]] and sync with Readwise.

> **Papers**: See [[Cards/000 - Knowledge Management/Workflows/My Zotero Workflow\|My Zotero Workflow]]

## Processing Notes
- [[Cards/000 - Knowledge Management/The Konik Method\|The Konik Method]]
- Link to related notes
- Reflect on the content, think on how I can apply it to my life
- Create new notes based on information (or just keep and do progressive summarization)
- Create aliases to help with retrieval
	- What would you search if you needed this information?

## Projects
- Create Project using quickadd hotkey `cmd + shift + p`
- Create a corresponding [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Todoist\|Todoist]] project with the same name as the project filename in order to automatically pull tasks from Todoist.
