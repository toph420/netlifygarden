# Atomic Notes

> What are atomic notes, and how to take them

*Everyone's definition of atomic notes will vary based on their needs.*

### Whats in a note
- Each note should be concerned about a separate thing. 
- Notes should represent **ideas**.
- Think of your notes as **building blocks** or **clay/paint**.
- We don't take notes to have a summary of the article, but rather to synthesize the note based on our own conceptual framework of ideas. 
- One idea note should have all the sources related to that idea.
- Every output we create is an argument, which are a string of ideas.
- Separate ideas allow us to reuse the ideas in different scenarios.

### When do we use our notes
- To see where the idea came from
- To strengthen our argument
