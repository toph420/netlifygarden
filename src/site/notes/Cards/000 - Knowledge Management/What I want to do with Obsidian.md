# What I want to do with Obsidian

- keep track of projects
- Keep track of tasks
- Keep track of people
- Keep track of businesses 
- Keep track of clients
- Track sales stage of prospects
- Develop ideas 💡 over time
- Track sources (videos, links, books, articles)
- for each project I want to be able to use a hot key to insert a project template to a new note. 
- I want to be prompted for the title of the project, the due date, the client (fill in the rest later)
- When a new project is created I want to move it to a newly created folder within the selected project folder (ie spaces/Ducks films/projects/project-name). I also want a new folder created for the project titled  ‘project-name/files’ to store any related deliverables, graphics, fonts related to a specific project but not already related to the top level client of the project.
- Possibly move projects outside of spaces, can always move them back in if needed, but then again what about Ducks Films specific notes, maybe keep it in spaces. 
- For each client I want to use a hot key to insert a client template into a person or organization note. 
- The template will add related meetings, todos, projects, and files, and be tagged `#client`
- When inserting a client template I want to move the note to a new ‘client-name’ folder also want to create a folder called ‘client-name/files’ and move the new client folder to a folder called ‘CRM’ in ‘Cards’
- for capturing web links I want to created a new note for each type, selecting from a drop down for ‘video, article, link, book, etc’
- I want to have a place to view any recently added sources in order to fine tune them and link them to other areas of interest ie `#on/pkm` 
- I want quick access to new meetings 
- I want quick access to project related notes
- When creating a new project note select the related project from a drop down or add it manually to the frontmatter ‘project’ property or at the end in the form of ‘Related Project: Project Link’
- Display these notes in each project page under Related Notes using query from `#project/resource` and inlinks, or just use inlinks but these may be references unrelated to the project. 
- If using a project note template it may be possible to automatically move the new note to the related project folder by triggering within the template to use the project property value to find the folder
- for tasks I want to be able to track various types of tasks: `#task`, tasks without a #, tasks with a `#💡`, tasks related to projects (these can be within daily notes or project resources or project pages, anywhere) using `#🪛` and/or the description includes a link to the project.
- On project pages I want to see all tasks with `#🪛` where description contains link to the project
- On client pages I want to see all related projects and their tasks grouped by project sorted by priority, then due.
