# Progressive Summarization

> A guide to researching and actually synthesizing the knowledge.

> [!abstract] Ava
> **Progressive summarization** is a text summarization technique that involves gradually reducing the length of the original text while maintaining the most important content. This technique starts by removing unnecessary words and sentences, then identifies common topics and key ideas, and finally restructures the remaining sentences to produce a concise summary. Progressive summarization can be used to reduce long texts into more manageable chunks, allowing readers to quickly grasp the main points of a document.
