# TIMs EVER Notes

> [!abstract] EVER Notes
> EVER(GREEN)
> 
> This is the status field in my notes. The purpose behind this status is to be an intentional classification of how developed the note is.Â [1](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/#fn-1-8d3f2dfc2d869f5c)
> 
> -   **`#EVER/SEED`**Â notes that may only have a couple sentences or a few links. They are speculative insights, that I have either gathered from external resources or found through connections of other notes. They could grow into sprouts within a few weeks, or months, but can accumulate backlinks and resources that will help them grow in time.Â 
> -   **`#EVER/SAPLING`**Â notes that have a body that fleshes out their core concept, but haven't had the chance to develop into something evergreen.Â 
> -   **`#EVER/GREEN`**Â There are three main aspects that make a note evergreen: Quality ofÂ [understanding](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/30_Topics/31_Stubs/understanding), frequency of use, and level of insight. If a note is strong in any of these areas then I will classify it as evergreen.Â 
> 
> These first three refer primarily to how developed the note is, but also come with the idea that I do not have any current intention of working on them.Â [2](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/#fn-2-8d3f2dfc2d869f5c)Â This means that any ideas that I have for them should be marked with `#TO` tags. There should be no limit on home many of these notes I have.Â [3](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/#fn-3-8d3f2dfc2d869f5c)
> 
> -   **`#EVER/WEED`**Â notes that have content that I am not happy with, these are filtered out from my publish vault.Â 
> -   **`#EVER/SPROUT`**Â notes that I am unsure of what stage they are at. All new notes come in with this tag, and will sit here until I am confident enough to assign them a stronger classification. There is less pressure to understand what needs to be done and what needs to be connected because these are in my priority que. If the number of the notes with this status is getting overwhelming, that probably means I am hitting theÂ [limit of how much information you can process at once](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/40_Evergreens/There+is+a+limit+to+how+much+information+you+can+process+at+once)Â and something is going to get lost. At that point, I need to go through and define relationships and what needs to be worked on. Then I can either add them to myÂ [incremental writing](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/incremental+writing)Â que or wait forÂ [spaced repetition](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/30_Topics/32_Terms/spaced+repetition)Â to bring them up again.
