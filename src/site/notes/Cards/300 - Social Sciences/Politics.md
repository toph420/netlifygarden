Topics treated in the journal's articles include anti-[[Cards/300 - Social Sciences/Capitalism\|capitalism]], anti-statism, Situationism, feminism, and the history of late 20th century revolutionary movements, especially May 1968 in France, the Italian Years of Lead, and the anti-globalization protests of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The journal's articles were written anonymously; as a result, the word Tiqqun is also used to name the articles' collective of authors, and other texts attributed to them. |
