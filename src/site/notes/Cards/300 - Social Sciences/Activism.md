- [Rei Squirrels thread with a bunch of 60s talk show segments discussing protesting of the Vietnam war](https://x.com/zei_squirrel/status/1786017867340595656?s=46) - striking similarities to the rhetoric of todays media and how they discuss the protests of Israel‚Äôs genocide in Gaza

## Protests
- I find it hilarious that people get so butthurt about the protesters that spray cornflour water soluble ‚Äúpaint‚Äù on famous artificers, ie the Mona Lisa or Stonehenge‚Ä¶ even going as far to call for them to be put to death [Matt Walsh](https://x.com/mattwalshblog/status/1803422389776109614?s=46). Here‚Äôs a thread from an apolitical guy discussing how benign the the paint is at Stonehenge and how it has been used many times in the past as a protest place: [Stephen Fisher on Stonehenge Protest](https://x.com/seaspitfires/status/1803557459543400831?s=46)
