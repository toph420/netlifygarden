### id448696835 Nanotechnology cleans up oil spills

> The process is relatively simple. These particles could be deployed at a spill site where they'll mix in with the oil. Because the particles are hydrophobic, there's little risk that they'll mix in with the water. Once we have an oil and nanoparticle slurry, it's just a matter of using magnets to grab onto the mix, and separate it from the water (via [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2012/09/21/tech/oil-spill-magnets)). What's more, researchers suggest the particles could then be removed from the oil, if desired, so that it could be used as intended. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnwq6q97xdqzebzjt7t86506)</span>

- [N] Crazy, using [[Cards/600 - Applied Sciences/Technology/Nanotechnology\|Nanotech]] to clean up oil by mixing with the oil and magnetising the sludge out of the water, wtf.
