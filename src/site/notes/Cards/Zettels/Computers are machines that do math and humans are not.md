# Computers are machines that do math and humans are not

> Are computers really that impressive compared to us?

It's easy for us to get grandiose about [[Cards/600 - Applied Sciences/Technology/AI/🤖 Artificial Intelligence\|🤖 Artificial Intelligence]]. Of course it's impressive, but ultimately computers are machines that do math. Humans are not. For example, without *instinct* are we making more mistakes, perhaps fewer?

And when you are building a computer program, it'll work if you do it this way and then it won't work if you do it the other way. But that's not how culture operates. That's not how relationships work. So there's a really a fundamental difference between what we can do with computers and what we can do in society. Because when it comes right down to it, computers are machines that do math. They compute. And we forget that when we get grandiose about artificial intelligence and we get grandiose about our imaginings.
