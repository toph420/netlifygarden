## Stories Read

See [[Sources/📚 Books/Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick\|Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick]]

- **Beyond Lies the Wub** - A telepathic philosophical a Wub, a large slow pig like creature, requests not to be eaten, but ultimately the captains hunger wins. 
- **Roog** - Boris the dog has a bone to pick with those snoopy Roogs, aka the garbage men.
- **Paycheck** - 4.5/5 - A story about a working man that takes his fate into his own hands. His memory is wiped after working with a company building a "time scoop" that allows people to see their future. He gives himself a bag of trinkets to help his future self come out on top. 
	- This one is a serious banger! Lots of action, got the sci-fi time mechanics, action packed spy thriller, and a happy satisfying ending. It made me think a bit about PKDs politics throughout as he discussed the state, police, the corporations, property and capital, and the working class. Even criticizing [[McCarthyism\|McCarthyism]] at one point - Here's an interesting review/analysis from someone: [Short Story Review: “Paycheck” by Philip K. Dick – Science Fiction & Fantasy Remembrance](https://sffremembrance.com/2023/07/17/short-story-review-paycheck-by-philip-k-dick/) *"Paycheck was published in the June 1953 issue of Imagination, but it was probably written a full year earlier, during the height of McCarthyism. Some editors in the field were squeamish about publishing material that criticized McCarthy and other anti-communism fanatics, but some stories slipped through the cracks. Jennings and Kelly have a bit of an argument where Kelly says that anyone who’s against the SP must be on the side of good, to which Jennings says, “Really? I’ve heard that kind of logic before. Any one fighting communism was automatically good, a few decades ago.” Dick was not a leftist, but he did have several leftist friends; in some ways he was a fellow traveler"*
- **The Second Variety** - 5/5 Loved this one! Soldiers are fighting, there are robots among them. A lone soldier goes out to the Russians to potentially end the war but discovers there are robots imitating certain soldiers, and there are multiple varieties. Although this one becomes a bit predictable toward the end the action is awesome and the twist still hits. The last line is too good, "they were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other." Meaning that even though the Second variety escaped in his rocket back to the moon base they would eventually destroy themselves, ironic vengeance. 
- **The Imposter** - A great little story about a robot that infiltrates and impersonates an unknowing human victim, Olham. He's convinced he's not the robot with the bomb that can be triggered with a phrase and goes to great lengths to try to prove it, and almost does so. At the last second he accidentally, as if inevitable, utters the phrase that triggers the bomb. A perfect plan by the aliens. Super fun, super quick, great twist, albeit predictable (had me for a few at the last second).
- **The King of the Elves** - 3.75/5 - a cute, fun story about an old man that owns a gas station in the middle of nowhere. One day he helps out some elves, and they make him their elf king. His friends think he's crazy. The elves need help defeating the trolls, and it turns out his good friend Phineas is the troll god! In a glorious battle he helps defeat the trolls and accepts his reign as king. I loved this, not sure the subtext of it but it's a damn fun and entertaining story.
- **The Adjustment Team** - 5/5 - This is freaking awesome. Ed unknowingly bares witness to an adjustment, a necessary process that takes place in order to shape the outcome of reality. In his case he was not summoned in time and ended up in the middle of the adjustment, witnessing reality fall apart before his eyes. Upon meeting with the adjustment team he vows to never tell a soul and convinces his wife it was just a mental break. When his wife almost pries it out of him a salesman rings the doorbell and saves the day. 
	- There's been a movie made from this idea called [The Adjustment Bureau](https://youtu.be/fSeWHl1PaKs?si=220FtYQMEaYSC0R8) with Matt Damon. This story could definitely be a novel, and I'm sure has inspired a lot of other stories out there. I wanted more, but the bite size story is very satisfying and fun, even a bit terrifying.
- **Foster, You're Dead** - 3.75/5 a kid begs his "anti-p" dad for a new bomb shelter. These days corpos aren't selling cars or tvs anymore, but instilling anxiety and fear in folks so that they buy and donate to defense systems. Dad succumbs to his sons wishes, but the day after an upgrade is deemed necessary. Eventually dad returns the shelter, but continues to donate to the defense fund and pays into the public shelter, which in emergency will cost the kid only 50cents. 
	- A great little dystopian, anti consumerism, capitalism critique. We see this already in our daily lives, fear mongering to sell stuff, and some folks are already doomsday prepping like these folks. The ending was a bit bleak, with the kid hiding in the returned shelter only to be kicked out by the salesmen. Perhaps this is the moment he, or even the salesmen become "anti-p" like his dad was.
- **The Days of Perky Pat** - 3.5/5 - I'm currently reading [[Sources/📚 Books/The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\|The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]] and this short story is the inspiration for the book I believe. Perky Pat is like a Barbie, folks are in a dystopian world destroyed by war and live vicariously through this doll and the custom "layouts" that they construct for them. One "fluke" faction gets word that another has hold of another doll, Connie Companion. Norman decides to challenge the other group to a game, the stakes are high, if they lose they lose Perky Pat, otherwise they win Connie. They win and upon return they are met with astonishment as other members of the fluke discover that Connie is more advanced, mature, older, married, pregnant. This morally corrupted new doll outrages them, they aren't prepared for this sacrilege and drive Norm out of their. 
	- I've seen some folks give this one some mediocre reviews, but I love it. I love the idea that a long lost life can be so intriguing and sought after, romanticizing about a previous time period, life, world, and represented through an artifact, technology. Not quite sure the deeper meaning, but it has something to do with "the eternally feminine" as PKD puts it, yearning, fear, isolation. Another interesting piece is that the children are unlike the adults, they aren't interested in the dolls, they're interested in living in the current world they were born into.

## About his Style


> [!ava]+ PKD's Style of Prose
> 
> 1. Paranoia and Uncertainty Dick often creates a pervasive sense of unease and doubt about reality. Example: "He felt certain that the walls were watching him, recording his every move for some unseen authority."
> 2. Everyday Language with Philosophical Depth Dick uses accessible language to explore complex ideas. Example: "The door refused to open. It said, 'Five cents, please.'" This simple sentence introduces the concept of ubiquitous AI and commercialization of basic services.
> 3. Rapid Shifts in Perspective Dick frequently and abruptly changes viewpoints or reality itself. Example: "One moment he was walking down a street in 2023, the next he found himself in a field in 1954. He blinked, unsure which was real."
> 4. Blending of the Mundane and the Extraordinary Dick often inserts surreal or sci-fi elements into ordinary settings. Example: "He reached for his morning coffee, only to find the mug was conversing with the toaster about the nature of existence."
> 5. Short, Punchy Dialogue Dick's characters often speak in brief, impactful exchanges. Example: "Are you human?" "I think so." "You think so?" "Don't you?"
> 6. Exploration of Identity and Memory Dick frequently questions the nature of self and the reliability of memory. Example: "As he sifted through his memories, he wondered which ones were truly his and which had been implanted by the corporation."
> 7. Irony and Dark Humor Despite heavy themes, Dick often employs a wry, ironic tone. Example: "The android believed it was more human than the humans. In a way, it was right."
> 8. Technical Details Mixed with Emotional Responses Dick balances sci-fi concepts with human reactions. Example: "The time-slip generator hummed ominously. John felt a deep sense of loss for a future he hadn't yet experienced."
> 9. Open-Ended Conclusions Dick often leaves endings ambiguous, inviting reader interpretation. Example: "As the simulation ended, he woke up. Or did he?"
> 
> Structural Techniques:
> 
> 1. Non-linear Narratives: Dick often jumps between timelines or realities.
> 2. Multiple Viewpoints: He frequently shifts between different characters' perspectives, sometimes mid-chapter.
> 3. Nested Realities: Stories within stories, or layered simulations, are common.
> 4. Repetition with Variation: He revisits scenes or phrases with slight alterations to create a sense of déjà vu or parallel realities.
> 
> To emulate Dick's style, consider:
> 
> - Starting with a familiar setting, then gradually introducing unsettling elements.
> - Using simple language to describe complex or bizarre concepts.
> - Creating an atmosphere of paranoia by having characters question their surroundings and themselves.
> - Blending philosophical questions with everyday situations.
> - Employing abrupt shifts in reality or perspective to keep readers off-balance.
> - Leaving some questions unanswered, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions.
> 
> Remember, Dick's strength lies not just in his imaginative concepts, but in how he uses them to explore fundamental questions about reality, humanity, and consciousness.
