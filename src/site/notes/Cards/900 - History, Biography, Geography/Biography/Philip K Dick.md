## Stories Read

See [[Sources/📚 Books/Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick\|Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick]]

- **Beyond Lies the Wub** - A telepathic philosophical a Wub, a large slow pig like creature, requests not to be eaten, but ultimately the captains hunger wins. 
- **Roog** - Boris the dog has a bone to pick with those snoopy Roogs, aka the garbage men.
- **Paycheck** - A story about a working man that takes his fate into his own hands. His memory is wiped after working with a company building a "time scoop" that allows people to see their future. He gives himself a bag of trinkets to help his future self come out on top. 
	- This one is a serious banger! Lots of action, got the sci-fi time mechanics, action packed spy thriller, and a happy satisfying ending. It made me think a bit about PKDs politics throughout as he discussed the state, police, the corporations, property and capital, and the working class. Even criticizing [[McCarthyism\|McCarthyism]] at one point - Here's an interesting review/analysis from someone: [Short Story Review: “Paycheck” by Philip K. Dick – Science Fiction & Fantasy Remembrance](https://sffremembrance.com/2023/07/17/short-story-review-paycheck-by-philip-k-dick/) *"Paycheck was published in the June 1953 issue of Imagination, but it was probably written a full year earlier, during the height of McCarthyism. Some editors in the field were squeamish about publishing material that criticized McCarthy and other anti-communism fanatics, but some stories slipped through the cracks. Jennings and Kelly have a bit of an argument where Kelly says that anyone who’s against the SP must be on the side of good, to which Jennings says, “Really? I’ve heard that kind of logic before. Any one fighting communism was automatically good, a few decades ago.” Dick was not a leftist, but he did have several leftist friends; in some ways he was a fellow traveler"*
- **The Second Variety** - Loved this one! Soldiers are fighting, there are robots among them. A lone soldier goes out to the Russians to potentially end the war but discovers there are robots imitating certain soldiers, and there are multiple varieties. Although this one becomes a bit predictable toward the end the action is awesome and the twist still hits. The last line is too good, "they were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other." Meaning that even though the Second variety escaped in his rocket back to the moon base they would eventually destroy themselves, ironic vengeance. 
- **The Imposter** - A great little story about a robot that infiltrates and impersonates an unknowing human victim, Olham. He's convinced he's not the robot with the bomb that can be triggered with a phrase and goes to great lengths to try to prove it, and almost does so. At the last second he accidentally, as if inevitable, utters the phrase that triggers the bomb. A perfect plan by the aliens. Super fun, super quick, great twist, albeit predictable (had me for a few at the last second).
- **The King of the Elves** - a cute, fun story about an old man that owns a gas station in the middle of nowhere. One day he helps out some elves, and they make him their elf king. His friends think he's crazy. The elves need help defeating the trolls, and it turns out his good friend Phineas is the troll god! In a glorious battle he helps defeat the trolls and accepts his reign as king. I loved this, not sure the subtext of it but it's a damn fun and entertaining story.
- **The Adjustment Team** - This is freaking awesome. Ed unknowingly bares witness to an adjustment, a necessary process that takes place in order to shape the outcome of reality. In his case he was not summoned in time and ended up in the middle of the adjustment, witnessing reality fall apart before his eyes. Upon meeting with the adjustment team he vows to never tell a soul and convinces his wife it was just a mental break. When his wife almost pries it out of him a salesman rings the doorbell and saves the day. 
	- There's been a movie made from this idea called [The Adjustment Bureau](https://youtu.be/fSeWHl1PaKs?si=220FtYQMEaYSC0R8) with Matt Damon. This story could definitely be a novel, and I'm sure has inspired a lot of other stories out there. I wanted more, but the bite size story is very satisfying and fun, even a bit terrifying.


## About his Style


> [!ava]+ PKD's Style of Prose
> 
> 1. Paranoia and Uncertainty Dick often creates a pervasive sense of unease and doubt about reality. Example: "He felt certain that the walls were watching him, recording his every move for some unseen authority."
> 2. Everyday Language with Philosophical Depth Dick uses accessible language to explore complex ideas. Example: "The door refused to open. It said, 'Five cents, please.'" This simple sentence introduces the concept of ubiquitous AI and commercialization of basic services.
> 3. Rapid Shifts in Perspective Dick frequently and abruptly changes viewpoints or reality itself. Example: "One moment he was walking down a street in 2023, the next he found himself in a field in 1954. He blinked, unsure which was real."
> 4. Blending of the Mundane and the Extraordinary Dick often inserts surreal or sci-fi elements into ordinary settings. Example: "He reached for his morning coffee, only to find the mug was conversing with the toaster about the nature of existence."
> 5. Short, Punchy Dialogue Dick's characters often speak in brief, impactful exchanges. Example: "Are you human?" "I think so." "You think so?" "Don't you?"
> 6. Exploration of Identity and Memory Dick frequently questions the nature of self and the reliability of memory. Example: "As he sifted through his memories, he wondered which ones were truly his and which had been implanted by the corporation."
> 7. Irony and Dark Humor Despite heavy themes, Dick often employs a wry, ironic tone. Example: "The android believed it was more human than the humans. In a way, it was right."
> 8. Technical Details Mixed with Emotional Responses Dick balances sci-fi concepts with human reactions. Example: "The time-slip generator hummed ominously. John felt a deep sense of loss for a future he hadn't yet experienced."
> 9. Open-Ended Conclusions Dick often leaves endings ambiguous, inviting reader interpretation. Example: "As the simulation ended, he woke up. Or did he?"
> 
> Structural Techniques:
> 
> 1. Non-linear Narratives: Dick often jumps between timelines or realities.
> 2. Multiple Viewpoints: He frequently shifts between different characters' perspectives, sometimes mid-chapter.
> 3. Nested Realities: Stories within stories, or layered simulations, are common.
> 4. Repetition with Variation: He revisits scenes or phrases with slight alterations to create a sense of déjà vu or parallel realities.
> 
> To emulate Dick's style, consider:
> 
> - Starting with a familiar setting, then gradually introducing unsettling elements.
> - Using simple language to describe complex or bizarre concepts.
> - Creating an atmosphere of paranoia by having characters question their surroundings and themselves.
> - Blending philosophical questions with everyday situations.
> - Employing abrupt shifts in reality or perspective to keep readers off-balance.
> - Leaving some questions unanswered, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions.
> 
> Remember, Dick's strength lies not just in his imaginative concepts, but in how he uses them to explore fundamental questions about reality, humanity, and consciousness.
