# Decoding the human genome

> {{VALUE:Summary}}

The structure of DNA was discovered in the late 1950s. The human genome was decoded in 2003 by International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. 

> It's kind of the book of life that's inside each cell. It's incredibly inspiring to think about this, and it is the same kind of molecule that all living things on this planet use. Another reason to be pretty sure that we're all descended from some common ancestor, and that as this information molecule evolved over time, it took on different letters and different orders, but it was still that double helix with all of that **potential**.
