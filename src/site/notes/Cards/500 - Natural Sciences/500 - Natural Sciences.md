> [!ava]+ Ava's 500 - Natural Sciences Summary
> Natural sciences refer to scientific disciplines that study the natural world and its phenomena, including living organisms, physical structures, and natural processes. These disciplines aim to provide an understanding of the laws and principles that govern the natural world through the application of scientific methodological approaches such as experimentations, observations, data analyses, and hypotheses testing.
> 
> Some potential notes related to natural sciences include:
> 
> - Natural sciences encompass various fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, environmental science, and earth science.
> - Physics deals with the study of matter and energy in the universe.
> - Chemistry focuses on the composition and properties of substances and how they interact with each other.
> - Biology is concerned with exploring living organisms' characteristics, behavior, interactions with their environment.
> - Geology explores the earth's structure and processes through time from the core to outer space.
> - Astronomy studies different celestial objects such as planets, moons, stars, galaxies within our universe.
> - Environmental science examines how human activities affect natural systems' functioning and biodiversity levels.
> - Earth science is a broad category that includes geology; meteorology; hydrology; oceanography; atmospheric science that all aim to explain how planet earth works.
> - Natural sciences enable us to understand how different factors interact in this world to shape our environment. This understanding could lead us towards more sustainable practices.
