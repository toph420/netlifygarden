# Automata

> Machines that automatically do something simple

> [!Ava] Definition: Automata
> Automata refers to machines or computational models that operate on a set of inputs to produce a set of outputs based on a sequence of predefined rules or criteria. They are often used in computer science and mathematics to study and model complex algorithms and processes, including language recognition, artificial intelligence, robotics, and more. Common types of automata include finite state machines, pushdown automata, Turing machines, and cellular automata. 

> So there was always this idea of replicating nature, replicating movement because movement was related to life. I think [[industrialism\|industrialism]] was in many ways a culmination of all those ideas that have been, people have been experimenting on and off for at least 2000 years. - George Zarkadakis on [[Sources/🎙 Podcasts/A More Perfect Human\|A More Perfect Human]]
