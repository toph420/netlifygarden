# Singularity (AI)

> When AI gets smart enough to make itself smarter and achieves super intelligence

Define singularity as it relates to artificial intelligence and cite sources and quotes. Also provide further questions to research.

> [!Ava]+ Ava's Definition of Singularity
> Singularity, as it relates to artificial intelligence, refers to a hypothetical event when a superintelligent AI becomes capable of recursive self-improvement, leading to an exponential increase in intelligence beyond human comprehension. The term was coined by mathematician and computer scientist Vernor Vinge in his 1993 paper "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era."
> 
> Vinge writes, "Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended." He argues that once a singularity-level AI is created, it will quickly become much smarter than its creators and lead to radical changes in society.
> 
> This concept has been further explored by science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke and has gained traction among some futurists and researchers in the field of artificial general intelligence.
> 
> Further questions to research on this topic might include:
> 
> - What specific advancements in artificial intelligence would be necessary for us to reach singularity?
> - What are some potential risks and benefits of creating an AI that surpasses human intelligence?
> - How do different AI experts and researchers feel about the possibility of singularity?
> - What ethical considerations must be taken into account when working towards or considering singularity?
