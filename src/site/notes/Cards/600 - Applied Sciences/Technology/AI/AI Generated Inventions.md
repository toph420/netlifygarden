> AI has been inventing stuff. Uh oh.

> AI is already powering inventions in almost every domain, from creating music, art, and literature to developing scientific theories. Recently, DABUS, an artificial inventive machine, came up with ideas for two patentable inventions. While the first invention relates to a device that attracts attention and is helpful in search and rescue operations, the second is a type of beverage container.
