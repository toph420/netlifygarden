# Large Language Models

> Large language models are powerful artificial intelligence tools that can generate human-like text and solve complex language tasks.

> [!ava] Ava's Summary
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that are trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. They are commonly used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as:
> 
> -   Text generation: LLMs can be used to generate new text based on a given prompt or seed text. For example, a news generation model can be trained on a dataset of news articles and then generate new articles on a given topic.
>     
> -   Language translation: LLMs can be used to translate text from one language to another. For example, Google Translate uses a LLM to translate text between multiple languages.
>     
> -   Text summarization: LLMs can be used to summarize long text documents into a shorter version. For example, a news summarization model can be trained on news articles and then summarize them into a shorter version.
>     
> -   Text classification: LLMs can be used to classify text into different categories. For example, a sentiment analysis model can be trained to classify whether text expresses a positive, negative or neutral sentiment.
>     
> -   Question-answering: LLMs can be used to answer questions based on a given text. For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 can be used to answer questions based on a given Wikipedia article.
>     
> -   Text generation: LLMs can be used to generate new text based on a given prompt or seed text. For example, a news generation model can be trained on a dataset of news articles and then generate new articles on a given topic.
>     
> -   Text completion: LLMs can be used to complete a partially given text. For example, autocomplete feature in smartphones that suggests the next word or phrase based on the context of the sentence.
>     
> -   Text generation for creative works: LLMs can be used to generate creative works such as poetry, fiction, and music. For example, MuseNet is a LLM that generates new music based on a given style or artist.
