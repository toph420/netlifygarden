# Using Chat GPT to Generate Prompts for AI
[](Midjourney.md)Teach [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Chat GPT\|Chat GPT]] to generate prompts for AI generated images

## Steps

> I want to generate detailed visual descriptions of different kinds of imaginary images, so that an AI can generate pictures. But first, I need to create templates for those descriptions, and I need
> 
> For instance:
> 
> 1.
> IMAGE TYPE: Fashion photo shoot
> EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year old Japanese woman, wearing a mauve cashmere pantsuite, joyful expression, garden in background, creative and dramatic fashion editorial photography y Rankin, 1995, 35mm lens, studio lighting
> SO THE FORMAT IS: A [number between 16 and 80]-year old [ethnic adjective] [man or woman], wearing [color] [material type] [fashion item], [mood adjective] and [adjective] fashion editorial photography by [name of a famous commercial photographer], [year between 1967 and 2018], [type of lens], [type of lighting]

> First of all, please come up with 8 more types of image.

Chat GPT will generate something like this:

> 1. Landscape photograph
> 2. Portrait photograph
> 3. Still life photograph
> 4. Sports photograph
> 5. Wildlife photograph
> 6. Nature photograph
> 7. Architectural photograph
> 8. Street photography
> 9. Abstract art
> 10. Figurative art

> For the first 5 items on that list, please generate example descriptions and formats, in the same way I showed you at the beginning of this conversation.

> Please generate 5 still life photograph descriptions using the format you just constructed. 

Then we can tell Chat to:

> Create a description and format for a new image type: 'Truly unique artistic image with incongruous elements not usually found together'

> Now generate 5 descriptions of those unique images using that format
