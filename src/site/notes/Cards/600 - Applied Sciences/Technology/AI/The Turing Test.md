# The Turing Test

> Can a computer convince us that it's intelligence is on par with humans?


> [!Ava] The Turing Test
> - The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human.
> - Created by Alan Turing in 1950, the test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which.
> - The machine passes the test if the judge cannot consistently identify it as the non-human participant.
> - An example of the Turing Test was performed in 2014 when a computer program named Eugene Goostman successfully convinced 33% of the judges that it was an actual 13-year-old Ukrainian boy.


> It was based on a parlor game for swapping gender that says a man and a woman leave the room and the party goers have to figure out who's the man and who's the woman by sending questions back and forth on paper. And the man's job is to try to pretend to be the woman and the woman's job is to be herself. And he says, what if we took the same test and replaced the man by a computer and the woman by any person?
