> | [[Sources/Zotero/Anti-Oedipus - Capitalism and Schizophrenia\|Anti-Oedipus - Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]<span class='summary'>Anti-Oedipus is a foundational text of schizoanalysis. Deleuze and Guattari critique traditional psychoanalysis (particularly the Oedipal complex) and argue that desire is not based on lack or fantasy but is a productive, material force connected to "desiring-machines." They analyze how social formations, especially capitalism, function by connecting and disconnecting these flows of desire and production, proposing a radical alternative to traditional understandings of the subject, mental illness, and social order.</span><span class='block'>2:24 AM - June 03, 2025</span> |
