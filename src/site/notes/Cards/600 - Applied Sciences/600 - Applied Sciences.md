The re-established circulation will be limited to a specific area of the body, either isolated to the abdominal area (A-NRP) or both in the abdominal and thoracic area (TA-NRP). Hence the term “regional perfusion”, indicating the perfusion is facilitated with the help of the ECOS in a specific region of the body, excluding the brain or brain stem.  |
