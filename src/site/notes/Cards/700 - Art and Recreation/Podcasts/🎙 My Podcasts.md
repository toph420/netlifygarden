## Pods to Check Out

- Archive 81
- [[Mabel\|Mabel]]
	- A folkloric feast of spookiness and sapphic goodness,¬†_Mabel_¬†presents its story through a series of phone calls and voicemails. It details the investigations of Anna Limon, a young woman who looks after an elderly woman full of tales of a girl called Mabel. When the fairytales start to seem more real than Anna thought, an odd friendship and an odder, more dangerous world unravel. This show is dreamy and thorny, full of lush descriptions and dialogue that you can feel teeming with moss. While listening, there is always the creeping feeling of something sharp and violent waiting around the corner to pull you into darkness, and as the more eldritch aspects of this show come to light, you‚Äôll want to jump right in it.
- [[Here Be Dragons\|Here Be Dragons]]
	- Harper Bennett, recent graduate of a Classical Mythology degree, is woken up one morning and whisked away on an expedition to the Bermuda Triangle. There‚Äôs rumour of a sea creature lurking in the depths, and Harper and her team sink down into the core of the truth in a submarine with only each other and hope to see them through. There‚Äôs also a cute AI, constructed from the remnants of museum audio guide clips for company and direction! Similar to¬†_Wolf 359_, this show tackles what happens when people are stuck in isolation and forced to co-operate, slowly building friendships as they uncover crazy conspiracies.
