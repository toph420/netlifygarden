# The Origins of Art

> Where does art come from?

40 to 60,000 years ago our ancestors began telling stories about how they experienced the world. 

> When love beckons to you, follow, though his ways are hard and steep. Through these stories, we project our hopes, fears and dreams onto the canvas of the invisible unknown.
> 
> The divine gift gift does not come from a higher power, but from our own mind. And that's what kicked off this amazing journey of our species to where we are today.
