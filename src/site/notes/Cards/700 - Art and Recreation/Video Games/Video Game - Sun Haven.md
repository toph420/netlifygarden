# Sun Haven

> Sun Haven tips and tricks



## Todo

- Craft an anvil for mine keys
- 2 sugar for baker station to make flour
- Cows for milk, cheese
- Sugar cane for sugar
- Peppers


---

- `I` for inventory, or `ESC` to pause time
	- hotbar is best for tools and weapons
	- use number or click to use
	- chest at foot of bed and make more using crafting table
- Use mouse to point and aim at enemies and place objects
- `M` brings up map
	- `?` over NPC = compelted quest
	- `!` = has a quest
- Rearrange using the pickaxe to remove, put them in hotbar, place w mouse
- Buildings need a demolition kit to be rearranged
- Press+`ESC` to bring up Skill Tree. 
	- 5 skills - exploration, farming, mining, fishing, combat
- Faster time for farming, slower for mining

## Farming
- Seeds at General Store, east of farm
	- Seeds on display are on sale
- Water and plant by holding and dragging
- Sell produce early to make cash, go to portal at east of farm next to brudge shaped like a star, press `E` to open portal
- Cooked food is more profitable, get a **Cooking Pot**
	- Nachos are profitable, plant corn, grind into flour, cook into tortillas, tortillas into chips, then nachos (green spice and cheese)
- Upgrade watering can at the anvil
	- After 30-40 dats use Earthquake and Raincloud spells to till and water

## Animals
- Get chickens and cows north of farm
- Cow and chx pens net to Bakery and Kittys house but initially a **Snaccoon** blocks the path of north stairs. Feed it food to get it to move, press E t to fill slots with apples, berries, etc. If hes still there go east into twon and north west to get to farm, south of Bakery.
- Do not need a barn to have cows and chx, can get one from town hall
	- should fence them cuz theyll wander (wooden posts and gate)
- Feed and pet them every day, fill them up w food
	- Can spam pet them to get to full heart
	- Feed animal feed by hand, make it at grinder (1 wheat 1 feed)
	- Place feeding stations next to animals, fill these up manually every day, 1 per each animal
	- Auto feeder from twon hall, palce next to feed stations, put feed in auto feeder
	- Auto collector will get eggs/milk

## Combat
- Around floor 6 of mines and on beach south of towm (lv. 4-8)
- Gain XP in West Forest, beat level 1 leafys, they also drop leafs which are useless but sometimes for quests
- Further west has slightly higher levels
- Use fireball spell to kill from a distance in early stages
- Defense+ w crafting copper armor on anvil. 
	- Mine copper in mines, smelt copper into ingots at furnace, make ingots into armors. Make both in furnace/anvil
- Need to level up to use certain armor/weapons, no point crafting silver gloves if you cant use em

## Exploration
- Wander and touch stuff. 
- Lots of foragables in west forest.
- Trees with spiderwebs, these give you silk sometimes and mushrooms.
- Turn silk into fabric by crafting a loom
## Fishing
- Sucks
- if you manage to get the fish bubble and the mana on catch a fish perk you are golden for fishing. There's a compact little pond just south of the town square but north of the beach that is an isolated spawn so it keeps refilling as the spell passes over it. It's a literal fish tornado! Just stand over the dock and fire! It always gets it's mana back. And it catches about 15 ish fish per cast on average. It's a bit of a grind to get to the point where you can do this. But once you're there it's pretty much free money. Especially once you get the procs for legendary fish and you start getting lots of golden/legendary fish which sell for a lot.
