# Video Game - Rimworld

> Tips and tricks for Rimworld

- [Scenario generator for Rimworld](https://scenariogenerator.net/generators/rimworld)
- Massive Mod list from Dr. Malbin [Created with RimPy Mod Manager v.1.2.6.28 (database: 28094334)](https://rentry.co/68nwt) (see [100 days on ice sheet](https://youtu.be/rp8NQ858A8M?si=TNZXUE8hvZrXSqtW))
## Beginner Tips
- When you first start
	- Temperate
	- Road makes travelling easier
	- River for hydropower
	- Build a single structure at a time
	- Put table in their room
- Work priorities
	- First 4 go to prio 1, people with higher skill get prio
	- Shift right click to queue up tasks, they will ignore other stuff they want to do tho
- Growing zones
	- Rice is better option, grows faster
	- Seperate growing zone for cotton to make into cloaks, parkas
	- Level 8 skill, make growing zone for healroot for herbal medicine
	- **Rice, Cotton, Healroot** -- food, clothing, medicine
	- **NURTIENT PASTE** -- make a dispenser early on, small mood debuff in echange for food efficient meals that are sterile and come with no risk of food
- Medical
	- Assign tab to change to herbal medicine, not high quality stuff first
- Working faster
	- Need light and temp control
	- 21 degrees celsius
	- keep mood good
	- claim decorative items from ruins and reinstall them
	- Research bench room, make it nice and comfortable, not crowded
		- get one down asap
		- research batteries first
		- plate armor next or solar panels/water wheels
	- Have good looking bedrooms too
	- Keep rooms clean
- Cooking meals
	- Seperate butchering tabel from cooking station
	- simple meals are fine early
	- assign them not to eat high quality food (fine or lavish meals)
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-05-21 at 4.44.20 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-05-21 at 4.44.20 PM.png]]
	- space to eat together, a table with some seats
- Prisoners
	- build seperate room for a prison, make it nice as possible
	- high social skill set to warden
	- dresser, bedside table, and bed, plant pots to decorate
	- Dont place close to storage or they could take a weapon
	- to convert to your ideology first, keep bad prison room (no bed no table no heater/cooler), lose faith faster when miserable, move to nice prison once recruited
- Make a hospital area
	- seperate room for makeshift infirmary for people you rescue
- Wood is highliy flamable
	- use stone cutting bench to turn stone into brick, granite strongers, marble best looking
- Have crafting near storage
- Have batteries in stone structure, can cause fire, and keep away from storage
- Hoarding luxury items makes you a target, so use them or sell them early
	- veterna players will often destroy (burn, grenade, drop from caravan) or gift items to remove excessive wealth
	- Wealth is also produced by abdnoned structures and their floors, destroy them early
- Other tips
	- Go into outfits tab and disallow wearing tainted clothing
	- In food restrictions tab disallow raw food and kibble (except berries)
	- Shelving is S tier for storage
		- Having a shelf set to critical store with your best textiles next to your tailor bench increases production, same goes with your other basics like steel, plasteel, components etc for armor and guns at the fab and machining table. Set your production tables to Drop on Floor let your unskilled pawns worry about hauling.
	- Research Devilstrand early, good for crafting own clothing, 3rd best beind thrumbfur and hyperweave, but way more accessible.
	- Research Cocoa trees early, chocolate is inefficient but boosts recreation with no drawbacks, never spoils and counts as fine food
	- Do not underestimate tribal weapons, Pila are deadly short range, longbow is devepively dangerous long range
	- see past messages in wealth graph page and select messages

## Drugs

![[Video Game - Rimworld - drug 1.png\|Video Game - Rimworld - drug 1.png]]


> I have a drug policy I swear by.  
>   
> Beer: Every day (if mood below 60%)  
> Smokeleaf Joint: Every 2 days (if mood below 50%)  
> Ambrosia: Every 2 days (If mood below 60%)  
> Psychite tea: Every 2 days (If mood below 40%)  
> Penoxycyline: Every 5 days  
>   
> The rest "For Addictions" only. And I also refuse any pawn with a "Chemical Interest" or "Chemical Fascination" from joining, 'cos they'll ignore my drug policy, get addicted, then end up burning through my supply.  
>   
> Although I may have to loosen the regulations where mood is concerned, since I recently implemented a "biphasic" sleeping schedule in my colony so that colonists generally stay above 60% mood anyway.  
>   
> Also it only occurred to me this most recent playthrough that I should be producing and selling yayo for easy money, so I've been doing that and it's been great.
## Kill Boxes

### The Singularity
[RimWorld Defense Guide - The Insane Singularity Killbox \[2024, 1.4\] READ COMMENT! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH9oyC9KZlE)

[Burn box](https://youtu.be/LHrw_SRSRm4?si=JHONrldFM4GfzydR)

- [ ] Add a zone and assign pawns to it when fighting
- [ ] Setup 2 kill boxes to bounce between

![[Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.43.19 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.43.19 PM.png]]

- 8 doors in a row
- barricade at the end of each end of the row
- on each side of door line put barricades, higher hp better
- from side you want them to enter add 7 more barricades
- add wall around this
- on side enemies come in use single doors in tunnel
- other side, shooter side, skip a tile and add door
- add barricades above and below it
- add wall on the other side 
-  add two more doors above and below wall
- add two chairs next to those doors
- add walls
![[Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.47.34 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.47.34 PM.png]]
- set all doors to be held open
- add inlaid wall here: this is for emp tossers to shoot in here while being safe
![[Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.48.42 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.48.42 PM.png]]
- Where to stand:
![[Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.50.33 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 10.50.33 PM.png]]
- when enemeies get through run out to close the door behind you and have another backup killbox ready
- best guns are close and medium range -- chain shotgun, smg, assault rifle. No miniguns or sniper or slow
- use collission
- use more than one emp thrower
	ss 

### Breach and Collission
- Check raid letter if it is *sapper* or *breacher* type
- **Pathable**: able to walk from current loc. to melee their target
- Walls and closed doors block pathing
- Targets include colonists, zonable animal (not farm animals), furniture/machinery
- Combatant target: colonists, zonable animals, powered turrets, baits ALL enemies
- Junk targets: chairs, benches, art, power gen, unpowered turrets, NOT ALL enemies
- **Squirrels** are wonderful (rat tortoiese etc)
- Need that target already a target before raid appears on the map
- **Held open doors** also work
- Dont use powered turret as target
- **Collission**: Enemies cant stand on top of each other, outside of combat they can stand on top of each other.
	- Stacked enemies that gain collission are bad and baloon out
	- See the squirrel baiting the collission
![[Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 11.08.46 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 11.08.46 PM.png]]
- Have this near entrance:
![[Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 11.09.54 PM.png\|Screenshot 2024-06-01 at 11.09.54 PM.png]]
- Or: **this is the way**
