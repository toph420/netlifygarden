A Discussion with Andrew Culp]]                                                                             | Andrew Culp is the author of Dark Deleuze, the controversial piece of Deleuze scholarship which challenges appropriations of Deleuze by academics and professionals uncommitted to a program of radical politics. Craig, Will, Matt, and Adam together interrogate Andrew on the finer points of the book.  Also, we discuss the similar dilution of Foucault's legacy. Some concepts on the table are negativity/positivity, ressentiment, the outside, imperceptibility, asymmetry, fugitivity, and destroying worlds.                 |

Deleuze and Guattari critique traditional psychoanalysis (particularly the Oedipal complex) and argue that desire is not based on lack or fantasy but is a productive, material force connected to "desiring-machines." They analyze how social formations, especially capitalism, function by connecting and disconnecting these flows of desire and production, proposing a radical alternative to traditional understandings of the subject, mental illness, and social order. |
