# Gender Dysphoria

> Gender dysphoria is a condition where someone feels distress because their gender does not match the gender they were assigned at birth

Untreated gender dysphoria can lead to a number of other symptoms, including depression, anxiety, low selfesteem, poor academic performance, struggling to build healthy relationships with friends or family, and suicidality.

Transgender youth have a *significantly* higher suicideality rate than their peers, and access to gender affirming care can help to improve their lives.
