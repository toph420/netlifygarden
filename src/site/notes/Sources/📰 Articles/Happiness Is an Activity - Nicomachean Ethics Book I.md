> > Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and every choice, is held to aim at some good. Hence people have nobly declared that the good is that at which all things aim.
> See what Aristotle is doing here: he is marking a leap in the inference with that phrase â€˜Hence people have nobly declared.â€™ But he wonâ€™t stop there. He will go on to argue for a few claims:
> 1.  That all actions aim at some good
>     
> 2.  That all actions aim ultimately at *the good,* which is a singular thing
>     
> 3.  That the good is happiness (*eudaimonia*)
>     
> 4.  That happiness is an activity of the soul in accord with virtue <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn7b2yz152w55nbb9eazjest)</span>

### id858125296

> The final definition we get from Aristotle is that happiness is an activity of the soul in accord with virtue. This is important: it is not just virtue, but rather the *activity* of acting virtuously by oneâ€™s own will. To do that is to live well, to flourish, to be happy. And that is the end of human life. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn7bczt3ykagm2b7jr0hyeby)</span>

### id858125391

> Two kinds of lives are mentioned favorably: the life of politics and the life of contemplation. Politics is an art which must coordinate all other arts, and so it is perhaps the highest art. But is it better to be a political beast or to live a life of contemplation? <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn7bgb0fny81x7wxd279cs8z)</span>
