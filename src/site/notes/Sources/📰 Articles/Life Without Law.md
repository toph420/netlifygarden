## Highlights

> I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody’s right to beautiful, radiant things.

### id835782555

> An anarchist is someone who rejects the domination of one person or class of people over another. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh10vgwb25rzzjzngjszyd9g)</span>

### id835782675

> There is no single perfect expression of anarchism, because anarchism is a network of ideas instead of a single dogmatic philosophy. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh10wbkw76hzqnqhpbkjaq38)</span>

### id835788510

> You’re obliged to pretend respect for people and institutions you think absurd. You live attached in a cowardly fashion to moral and social conventions you despise, condemn, and know lack all foundation. It is that permanent contradiction between your ideas and desires and all the dead formalities and vain pretenses of your civilization which makes you sad, troubled and unbalanced. In that intolerable conflict you lose all joy of life and all feeling of personality, because at every moment they suppress and restrain and check the free play of your powers. That’s the poisoned and mortal wound of the civilized world.  
> —Octave Mirbeau, 1899 <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh126hzp9de1y9s8cy0bc8sj)</span>

### id835789394

### id835789797

> the people in this world who act with total freedom and no responsibility are those so privileged in our society so as to be above reproach, such as the police and the ultra-rich. Most of the rest of us understand that in order to be free, we must hold ourselves accountable to those we care about and those our actions might impede upon: our communities and families and friends. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh12ekh9kqt3nyarsav926k0)</span>

### id835790041

> The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said “This is mine,” and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this imposter; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.

### id835790182

> In economic terms, this is the central myth of capitalism: that everyone should try to get one over on everyone else all the time, and that if everyone does that, most people win. The people who want you to believe that myth are the people who do win: the people who already control everything. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh12j614dhdk0pe6xhz6g6a0)</span>

### id835790299

> Capitalism does not, as is popularly misunderstood, mean an economic system in which people work for money that they can exchange for goods or services. Capitalism is, instead, an economic system in which people can leverage their access to *capital* to extort money from other people. That is to say, capitalism is the system by which people who own things don’t have to work and everyone else does. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh12mbjh3fczj532w99nvq79)</span>

### id835790612

> Some anarchists argue for **communism**, in which the means of production are held in common by communes. Others favor **mutualism**, in which means of production are owned by individuals or collectives and money is used but money can only be made through work, not through capital. Still others push for a system of **gift economics**, an organic system in which people give to one another freely and without compulsion, sharing when and what they would like with whom they’d like. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh12rf5559qpap716v0asy4b)</span>

### id835790681

> Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us.  
> —Leo Tolstoy, 1894 <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh12sjhb6am9mt7dm7vkrm6x)</span>

### id835791876

> No great idea in its beginning can ever be within the law. How can it be within the law? The law is stationary. The law is fixed. The law is a chariot wheel which binds us all regardless of conditions or place or time.

### id835792202

> We are opposed to law because law is a way of understanding human conduct that was designed—and has been implemented—for social control rather than for the furtherance of justice. Laws are designed to be obscure yet rigid, creating a series of traps for those who are already disenfranchised by society. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh1346qpn3r2rftdfcqd0baq)</span>

> I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation.

### id835793944

> Mutual aid is a fancy way of saying “helping each other out,” and it’s one of the core anarchist beliefs. We believe that people can interact in meaningful ways by sharing resources freely, without coercion. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh13ce7e43xkj3fny2bxzvgk)</span>

### id835793995

### id835794048

> Solidarity is, in some ways, the opposite of charity. Charity is a way of providing aid that reinforces the hierarchical relationship between groups. Rich people donating money to charity makes poor people even more dependent upon the rich. Poor people, however, organizing to share resources as equals, are acting out of solidarity. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh13e68hexnj351nwqwg0156)</span>

### id835794193

> Consent is a way of finding out what other people are interested in doing with you. Mostly, this just means asking people before you do things with them. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh13gj9jdzm5gf6dpytdxktt)</span>

### id835796045

> Some people mistake consensus to be basically the same as voting but where everyone agrees instead of a majority. This thinking however, is still built around voting, which is a form of competitive decision-making that is not designed to respect people’s autonomy. Consensus, instead of being a way to convince everyone to agree to the same plan, is a way of exploring what the logical limits of any given group are. If all members of a group cannot agree on a specific action, then it clearly needs to take place outside of that group, if at all. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh13nzx6tknp8gay3sqpy8v5)</span>

> Anarchists know that a long period of education must precede any great fundamental change in society, hence they do not believe in vote begging, nor political campaigns, but rather in the development of self-thinking individuals.

### id835796207

### id835796957

> The most famous strategy is that of **revolution**, in which a single, reasonably organized mass uprising allows for the oppressed classes to seize the means of production and take their lives into their own hands. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh144skty4jf5d1dn9jzaqac)</span>

### id835797122

> A second strategy is that of advocating and participating in **insurrections**. Insurrections are moments of freedom and revolt, often occurring in times of crisis. These insurrections would, ideally, allow for areas to be liberated from state control and, if they came in increasing strength and frequency, allow for a generalized revolt that could break state power. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh14849j96zkhkfnymcgqfph)</span>

> In the 1880s, anarchists fighting against wage labor in the United States got caught up in the fight for the eight-hour work day. After a series of labor rights culminating in a fight in Haymarket Square in Chicago, eight anarchists were put on trial explicitly for being anarchists. Four were hanged and one killed himself in jail as a result. Their martyrdom changed labor history in the US, the eight-hour workday fight was won, and anarchism continued to be a strong voice in the labor movement. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh14gfh1ag8rgnxj41qrnrf8)</span>
