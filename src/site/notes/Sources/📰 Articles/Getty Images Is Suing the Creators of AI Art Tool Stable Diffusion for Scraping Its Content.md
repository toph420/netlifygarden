# Getty Images Is Suing the Creators of AI Art Tool Stable Diffusion for Scraping Its Content

## Highlights
> Getty Images is suing Stability AI, creators of popular AI art tool Stable Diffusion, over alleged copyright violation.
> In a [press statement](https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-statement) shared with *The Verge*, the stock photo company said it believes that Stability AI “unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright” to train its software and that Getty Images has “commenced legal proceedings in the High Court of Justice in London” against the firm.<span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr541n99pjfxb6fgwx30q358)</span>

> “The driver of that [letter] is Stability AI’s use of intellectual property of others — absent permission or consideration — to build a commercial offering of their own financial benefit,” said Peters. “We don’t believe this specific deployment of Stability’s commercial offering is covered by fair dealing in the UK or fair use in the US. The company made no outreach to Getty Images to utilize our or our contributors’ material so we’re taking an action to protect our and our contributors’ intellectual property rights.”<span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr54335djxzt65k9acabpms1)</span>

> AI art tools like Stable Diffusion rely on human-created images for training data, which companies scrape from the web, often without their creators’ knowledge or consent. AI firms claim this practice is covered by laws like the US fair use doctrine, but many rights holders disagree and say it constitutes copyright violation. Legal experts are divided on the issue but agree that such questions will [have to be decided for certain in the courts](https://www.theverge.com/23444685/generative-ai-copyright-infringement-legal-fair-use-training-data).<span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr544nayt0w6yrrx6tqt354q)</span>

> Getty Images CEO Peters compares the current legal landscape in the generative AI scene to the early days of digital music, where companies like Napster offered popular but illegal services before new deals were struck with license holders like music labels.<span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr545befyky6e6n25zwgz304)</span>

> “I don’t think it’s about damages and it’s not about stopping the distribution of this technology,” Peters told *The Verge*. “I think there are ways of building generative models that respect intellectual property. I equate [this to] Napster and Spotify. Spotify negotiated with intellectual property rights holders — labels and artists — to create a service. You can debate over whether they’re fairly compensated in that or not, but it’s a negotiation based of the rights of individuals and entities. And that’s what we’re looking for, rather than a singular entity benefiting of the backs of others. That’s the long term goal of this action.”<span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr54enka3gkryrtde3267pat)</span>

> The full press statement from Getty Images is as follows:
> > Earlier today, Getty Images commenced legal proceedings in the High Court of Justice in London against Stability AI claiming Stability AI infringed intellectual property rights including copyright in content owned or represented by Getty Images. It is Getty Images’ position that Stability AI unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty Images absent a license to benefit Stability AI’s commercial interests and to the detriment of the content creators. 
> > 
> > Getty Images believes artificial intelligence has the potential to stimulate creative endeavors. Accordingly, Getty Images provided licenses to leading technology innovators for purposes related to training artificial intelligence systems in a manner that respects personal and intellectual property rights. Stability AI did not seek any such license from Getty Images and instead, we believe, chose to ignore viable licensing options and long-standing legal protections in pursuit of their stand-alone commercial interests.<span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr54evbdt98c66bsf5h8k849)</span>
