# Hegel for Beginners

> [!summary]+
> **summary**:: This article introduces Hegel's philosophy, focusing on key concepts such as totality, *Aufhebung* (sublation), negation, and triadic structure. Hegel emphasizes the importance of understanding the whole rather than just its parts, viewing development as a process where ideas are both overcome and preserved. His dialectical thinking uses negation to reveal contradictions and push towards a more comprehensive understanding. The article also touches on Hegel's critique of Kant's logic and his concept of absolute knowledge as the ultimate goal of philosophical thought.

> Totality
> For Hegel, only the whole is true. Every stage or phase or moment is partial, and therefore partially untrue. Hegel's grand idea is "**totality**" which preserves within it each of the ideas or stages that it has overcome or subsumed. Overcoming or subsuming is a developmental **process** made up of "moments" (stages or phases). The **totality** is the **product** of that process which preserves all of its "moments" as elements in a structure, rather than as stages or phases.
> Think of these structural elements as the interrelated ones of a whole architecture or even better, a **fractal** architecture. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsvvj5z9k3vp7qaerge3sgq)</span>

### id856058283

> *Aufhebung* or Sublation
> Aristotle's logic is concerned with separate, discrete (self-)identities in a deductive pattern. Hegel dissolves this classical static view in a dynamic movement towards the **whole**. The whole is an overcoming which preserves what it overcomes.
> Nothing is lost or destroyed but raised up and preserved as in a spiral. Think of the opening of a fern or a shell.
> This is an organic rather than mechanical logic. Hegel's special term for this "contradiction" of **overcoming** and at the same time **preserving** is *Aufhebung*, sometimes translated as "**sublation**".
> For anything to happen, everything has to be in place.
> Quantum theory, postmodern cosmology, chaos theory, computer interfacing and ecology all essentially subscribe to this view of "totality" in question, without being "hegelian". <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsvxpzhaaw0ynpxsw6rztsc)</span>

> A Grammar of Thinking
> "I liken my study of logic to the study of grammar. You only really see the rewards when you later come to observe language in use and you grasp what it is that makes the language of poetry so evocative".
> Hegel deals with a sequence of logical categories: being, becoming, one, many, essence, existence, cause, effect, universal, mechanism, and "life". Each is examined in turn and made to reveal its own inadequacies and internal tensions. Each category is made to generate another more promising one which in its turn will be subject to the same kind of scrutiny. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw1eswpx0qg0sb8nee5ys7)</span>

### id856058841

> Negation
> Hegel calls this dynamic aspect of his thinking the power of "**negation**". It is by means of this "negativity" of thought that the static (or habitual) becomes discarded or dissolved, made fluid and adaptable, and recovers its eagerness to push on towards "the whole".
> Dialectical thinking derives its dynamic of negation from its ability to reveal "contradictions" within almost any category or identity.
> Hegel's "contradiction" does not simply mean a mechanical denial or opposition. Indeed, he challenges the classical notion of static self-identity, A = A, or A not= non-A. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw4rdh9xkbpf1tv09hb8m2)</span>

> Three Kinds of Contradiction
> 1.  The three divisions of the Science of Logic involve three different kinds of contradiction. In the first division **Being** the opposed pair of concepts at first seem flatly opposed, as if they would have nothing at all to do with one another: Being Nothing / Quantity Quality. Only be means of analysis or deduction can they be shown to be intimately interrelated.
> 2.  In the second division **Essence** the opposed pairs immediately imply one another. The Inner and the Outer, for example: to define one is at the same time to define the other.
> 3.  In the third division the Concept [**Notion**] we reach an altogether more sophisticated level of contradiction. Here we have concepts such as identity whose component parts, Universality and Particularity, are conceptually interrelated. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw5rrf5bavm65mygsm4syq)</span>

> Triadic Structure
> If negation is the inner life-force of the dialectic, then **triadic structure** is its organic, fractal form.
> THESIS
> A thought is affirmed which on reflection proves itself unsatisfactory, incomplete of contradictory ...
> ANTITHESIS
> which propels the affirmation of its negation, the antithesis, which also on reflection proves inadequate ...
> SYNTHESIS
> and so is again negated ... <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmswb76nmr6zjxy31h6s4ynn)</span>

> Note: This formulation of Hegel's triadic logic is convenient, but it must be emphasised that he **never** used the terms thesis, antithesis and synthesis. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmswdsv3qc23b69nmwnybzjr)</span>

> Kant had distinguished two kinds of logic:
> 1.  The **analytic** logic of understanding which focuses the data of sense-experience to yield knowledge of the natural **phenomenal** world.
> 2.  The **dialectical** logic of understanding which operates independently of sense-experience and **erroneously** professes to give knowledge of the **transcendent noumena** ("things in themselves" or also the "infinite" or the "whole")
> Hegel's view is completely different.
> 1.  Analytic understanding is only adequate for natural science and practical everyday life, not for philosophy.
> 2.  Dialectic reason s not concerned with Kant's "transcendent", nor with the abstract "mutilated" parts of reality, but with reality as a **totality**, and therefore gives **true** knowledge. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmswej561nae1qj6swv3tm0x)</span>

> What is Knowing?
> Knowing, for Hegel, is something you **do**. It is an **act**. But it is also presence of mind. Hegel seems to hold out the vision, even the experience, of thinking as self-presence. Of being present to, or with, oneself of being fully self-possessed, self-aware. Of self-consciousness as a huge cosmic accomplishment. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmswgfwtn619y612en1yb51f)</span>

> Reading Hegel gives one a sense that the movement of thought will coincide with a vision of harmony that awaits us at the end of the whole process. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmswhahnsgccv1bb8mntzanr)</span>

### id856061548

> **Absolute Knowledge**, in the form of the complete self-consciousness and self-possession of spirit, is only available at the end-point of the think process. But there is no distinction possible between the driving energy of thought and this sense of harmony and fulfilment in the whole. It is ultimately the universal which has the upper hand. As Hegel's Logic puts it ...
> Everything depends on the "**identity** of identity and non-identity".
> In philosophy, the latest birth of time is the result of all the systems that have preceded it, and must include their principles: and so, if, on other grounds, it deserves the title of philosophy, it will be the fullest, most comprehensive, and most adequate system of all. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmswn7rdndhnj30meneawtrm)</span>
