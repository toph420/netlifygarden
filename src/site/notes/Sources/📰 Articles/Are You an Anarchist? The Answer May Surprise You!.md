# Are You an Anarchist? The Answer May Surprise You!

## Highlights
### id835770145

> Anarchists are simply people who believe human beings are capable of behaving in a reasonable fashion without having to be forced to. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zmfkajvgbfc28p0gq5m41)</span>

### id835770222

> The first is that human beings are, under ordinary circumstances, about as reasonable and decent as they are allowed to be, and can organize themselves and their communities without needing to be told how. The second is that power corrupts. Most of all, anarchism is just a matter of having the courage to take the simple principles of common decency that we all live by, and to follow them through to their logical conclusions. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0znxjqzftn6te6vq8azpm9)</span>

### id835770379

> The most basic anarchist principle is self-organization: the assumption that human beings do not need to be threatened with prosecution in order to be able to come to reasonable understandings with each other, or to treat each other with dignity and respect. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zpqj7g09c36ecnc48pjf2)</span>

### id835770561

> Anarchists argue that almost all the anti-social behavior which makes us think itâ€™s necessary to have armies, police, prisons, and governments to control our lives, is actually caused by the systematic inequalities and in- justice those armies, police, prisons and governments make possible. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zrcz4hatyk16ngk78kjgt)</span>

### id835770694

> anarchists believe that for the most part it is power itself, and the effects of power, that make people stupid and irresponsible. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zs4szjbjga23af3nfp1wc)</span>

### id835770742

> Another basic anarchist principle is voluntary association. This is simply a matter of applying democratic principles to ordinary life. The only difference is that anarchists believe it should be possible to have a society in which everything could be organized along these lines, all groups based on the free consent of their members, and therefore, that all top-down, military styles of organization like armies or bureaucracies or large corporations, based on chains of command, would no longer be necessary. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0ztah9qh9r60n62hszhn8c)</span>

### id835770924

> while people can be reasonable and considerate when they are dealing with equals, human nature is such that they cannot be trusted to do so when given power over others. Give someone such power, they will almost invariably abuse it in some way or another. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zw2ayg7js581vx70nd7pq)</span>

### id835770951

> Anarchists believe that power corrupts and those who spend their entire lives seeking power are the very last people who should have it. Anarchists believe that our present economic system is more likely to reward people for selfish and unscrupulous behavior than for being decent, caring human beings. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zws99z96rehrpt1th6738)</span>

### id835771147

> How many hours would we really need to work in order to maintain a functional society â€” that is, if we got rid of all the useless or destructive occupations like telemarketers, lawyers, prison guards, financial analysts, public relations experts, bureaucrats and politicians, and turn our best scientific minds away from working on space weaponry or stock market systems to mechanizing away dangerous or annoying tasks like coal mining or cleaning the bathroom, and distribute the remaining work among everyone equally? Five hours a day? Four? Three? Two? Nobody knows because no one is even asking this kind of question. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh0zzzxex1vfa7na0qxds8zr)</span>

### id835771666

> Pretty much every great worthwhile achievement in human history, every discovery or accomplishment thatâ€™s improved our lives, has been based on cooperation and mutual aid; even now, most of us spend more of our money on our friends and families than on ourselves; while likely as not there will always be competitive people in the world, thereâ€™s no reason why society has to be based on encouraging such behavior, let alone making people compete over the basic necessities of life. That only serves the interests of people in power, who want us to live in fear of one another. Thatâ€™s why anarchists call for a society based not only on free association but mutual aid. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh102m7cf9a7dfwjsw9sg6p1)</span>

### id835771968

> Every time you treat another human with consideration and respect, you are being an anarchist. Every time you work out your differences with others by coming to reasonable compromise, listening to what everyone has to say rather than letting one person decide for everyone else, you are being an anarchist. Every time you have the opportunity to force someone to do something, but decide to appeal to their sense of reason or justice instead, you are being an anarchist. The same goes for every time you share something with a friend, or decide who is going to do the dishes, or do anything at all with an eye to fairness. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh105pkvjmhgyz7mkej1q1mq)</span>
