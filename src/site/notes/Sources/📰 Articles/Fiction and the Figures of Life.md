> However, the moment our writer concentrates on sound, the moment he formalizes his sentences, the moment he puts in a figure of speech or turns a phrase, shifts a tense or alters tone, the moment he carries description, or any account, beyond need, he begins to turn his reader's interest away from the world which lies among his words like a beautiful woman among her slaves, and directs him toward the slaves themselves. This illustrates a basic principle: if I describe my peach too perfectly, it's the poem which will make my mouth water . . . while the real peach spoils. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpgygmf54wbppr5qct24hrqg)</span>

> an obsessive thought, a jealousy or hate so strong it renders you insensible to all else. Then while it lasts, you are that fear, that ache, for consciousness is always smaller than its opportunities, and Â· can contract around a kernel like a shell. A piece of music can drive you out and take your place. The purpose of a literary work is the capture of consciousness, and the conï¿½equent creation, in you, of an imagined sensibility, so that while you read you are that patient pool or cataract of concepts which the author has constructed; and though at first it might seem as if the ric,hness of life had been replaced by something less so-senseless noises, abstract meanings, mere shadows of worldly employment-yet the new self with which fine fiction and good poetry should provide you is as wide as the mind is, and musicked deep with feeling. While listening to such symbols sounding, the blind perceive; thought seems to grow a body; and the will is at rest amid that moving like a gull asleep on the sea. Perhaps we'll be forgiven, then, if we fret about our words and continue country-headed. It is not a refusal to please. There's no willfulness, disdain, exile ... no anger. Because a consciousness electrified by beauty-is that not the aim and emblem and the ending of all finely made love?

- [N] Hume on imagination, continued from previous highlight

"Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (New
York : Oxford University Press). There is reason to suppose that Burne thinks the imagination plays w'ith ideas only after they have lost all vivifying power. Then, however, their arrangement could satisfy only our conceptions of things, not our perceptions of them."

### id865213363

> We do visualize, I suppose. Where did I leave my gloves?
> And then I ransack a room in my mind until I find them. But the room I ransack is abstract-a simple schema. I leave out the drapes and the carpet, and I think of the room as a set of likely glove locations. The proportion of words which we can visualize is small, but quite apart from that, another barrier to the belief that vivid imagining is the secret of a character's power is the fact that when we watch the pictures which a writer's words have directed us to make, \\'e miss their meaning, for the point is never the picture. It also takes concentration, visualization does-takes slowing down; and this alone is enough to rule it out of novels, which are never waiting, always flowing on. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp3tvbazmwcjs0hfccb8h1p)</span>

### id865216160

> Enter Mr. Cashmore, who is a character in The Awkward Age.
> l\1r. Cashn1ore, who would have been very redheaded if he had not been very bald, showed a single eyeglass and a long upper lip ; he was large and jaunty, \Vith little petulant n1ovements and intense ejaculations that were not in the line of his type. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp4hb5nwg2kqjq3b7tw9093)</span>

### id865216275

> We can imagine any number of other sentences about Mr. Cashmore added to this one. Now the question is : what is Mr. Cashmore? Here is the answer I shall give: Mr. Cashmore is ( 1) a noise, ( 2 ) a proper name, ( 3 ) a complex system of ideas, ( 4) a controlling conception, ( 5) an instrument of verbal organization, ( 6) a pretended mode of referring, and ( 7) a source of verbal energy. 8 But Mr. Cashmore is not a person. He is not an object of perception, and nothing whatever that is appropriate to persons can be correctly said of him. There is no path from idea to sense (this is Descartes' argument in reverse), and no amount of careful elaboration of Mr. Cashmore's single eyeglass, his upper lip or jauntiness is going to enable us to see him. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp4ksvnj1p0kkjahahb1aff)</span>

- [N] Discussing the process of using imagination to construct the character, Mr. Cashmore using the provided words, and we'll never picture him for there are endless possibilities of him, but nonetheless we do.

(1) He is always a "mister," and his name functions musically
much of the time. "He was an odd compound, Mr. Cashmore, and the air of personal good health, the untarnished bloom which sometimes lent a monstrous serenity to his mention of the barely mentionable, was on occasion balanced or matched by his playful application of extravagant terms to matters of much less moment." What a large mouthful, that sentence. His name ( 2) locates him, but since he exists nowhere but on the page (6) , it simply serves to draw other words toward him ( 3 ), or actualize others, as in conversation ( 7), when they seem to proceed from him, or remind us of all that he is an emblem of (4), and richly interact with other, similarly formed and similarly functioning verbal centers (5 ).

### id865216605

> Characters in fiction are mostly empty canvas. I have
> known many who have passed through their stories without noses, or heads to hold them; others have lacked bodies altogether, exercised no natural functions, possessed some thoughts, a few emotions, but no psychologies, and apparently made love without the necessary organs. The true principle is direct enough: Mr. Cashmore has what he's been given; he also has what he hasn't, just as strongly. Mr. Cashmore, in fact, has been cruelly scalped. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp4qn1hp8mzw0hapy9pkyfe)</span>

- [N] Characters are just as much what they are not as what they are. 

### id865216969

> As a set of sensations Mr. Cashmore is simply impossible; as an idea he is admirably pungent and precise. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp4v121a86vw9gckj3scrmv)</span>

### id865220069

> So sometimes, then, we are required to take away what
> we've been given, as in the case of Mr. Cashmore's red hair; sometimes it's important to hold fast to what we've got and resist any inclination we may have to elaborate, as in the case of Mr. Mulholland, who I said had thumbs; and sometimes we must put our minds to the stretch, bridging the distances between concepts with other concepts, as in the two examples which follow; or we may be called upon to do all these things at once, as in what I promise will be my final misuse of poor Mulholland. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp4ydkq83nkgk05hcye7dxx)</span>

- [N] Examples of Mr. Mulholland and his thumbs

1. Well, I finally met Mr. Mulholland. Oh, what's he like? He has large thumbs.

2. Well, I finally met Mr. Mulholland. Oh, what's he like? A silver thimble.

3. I saw Mr. Mulholland today . Oh, what was he doing? Walking his thumbs.
Mr. Mulholland's face had a watchful look. Although its features had not yet arrived, they were rnomentarily expected.

> Only a few of the words which a writer normally uses

> 3Â· To the degree these images are as vivid and lively as

Then words would act like a mindexpanding drug. 4Â· To the degree these images are general schema, indistinct and vague, the great reality characters are supposed to have becomes less plausible, and precise writing (so often admired) will interfere with their formation. 5. Constructing images of any kind takes time, slows the
> flow of the work; nor can imagining keep up, in complexity, with the incredibly intricate conceptual systems which may be spun like a spiderweb in a single sentence. 6. We tend to pay attention to our pictures, and lose sight

### id865223158

> Ortega y Gasset asks us to imagine we are looking through a window at a garden.
> The clearer the glass is, the less (of the glass ) \Ve will see. But then making an effort we may withdraw attention from the garden; and by retracting the ocular ray, we may fixate it upon the glass. Then the garden will disappear in our eyes and we will see instead only some confused masses of color which seem to stick to the glass. Consequently to see the garden and to see the glass in the \Vindowpane are two incompatible operations .. .. Likewise he who in the work of art aims to be moved by the fate of John and Mary, or of Tristan and Iseult, and readjusts to them his spiritual perception will not be able to see the work of art .... Now the majority of people are unable to adjust their attention to the glass and the transparency which is the work of art ; instead they penetrate through it to pass ionately wallow in the human reality which the work of art refers to. If they are invited to let loose their prey and fix their attention upon the work of art itself, they will say they see nothing in it, because, indeed, they see no human realities there, but only artistic transparencies, pure essences. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp5bjjfzggy20ycstpkknxp)</span>

- [N] Beautiful passage, looking through a glass window at a garden, focusing on the garden is to see it for what it is, focusing on the glass is to see the art, the essence

> On the other side of a novel lies the void. Think, for instance, of a striding statue; imagine the purposeful inclination of the torso, the alert and penetrating gaze of the head and its eyes, the outstretched arm and pointing finger; everything would appear to direct us toward some goal in front of it. Yet our eye travels only to the finger's end, and not beyond. Though pointing, the finger bids us stay instead, and we journey slowly back along the tension of the arm. In our hearts we know what actually surrounds the statue. The same surrounds every other work of art: empty space and silence. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp5hq0dq48gh2vm5mtjxayq)</span>

> Mountains are characters in Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano, so is a ravine, a movie, mescal, or a boxing poster. A symbol like the cross can be a character. An idea or a situation (the anarchist in The Secret Agent, bomb ready in his pocket ), or a particular event, an obsessive thought, a decision (Zeno's, for instance, to quit smoking), a passion, a me.mory, the weather, Gogol's overcoat-anything, indeed, \vhich serves as a fixed point, like a stone in a stream or that soap in Bloom's pocket, functions as a character. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp5sjjt0351dc02zrrp0q6z)</span>

- [N] Characters can by symbols, ideas, events, situations, fixed points function as character

### id865225490

> Normally, characters are fictional human beings, and thus are given proper names. In such cases, to create a character is to give meaning to an unknown X; it is absolutely to define; and since nothing in life corresponds to these Xs, their reality is borne by their name. They are, where it is. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpp63kenejax94c7hx5js56y)</span>

> The scientist, after a time, finds himself with a store of observations of the natural world on the one hand, and a system of pure mathematical connections on the other. Within the mathematical system he can make inferences with great speed and accuracy. Unfortunately the system is empty; it has no content; it tells him nothing about the world. His observations tell him nothing either, for logical connections cannot be perceived; his data ren1ain disorganized; there are no paths through it for the mind. But if he decides to represent a body by a point and motion by a line, then the system becomes concrete, at once trapping a vast number of physical things in a web of logical relations. In this way the scientist makes his model. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq2q32pwtmj6z14eabhp1mqf)</span>

> Metaphors rarely have a thoroughly formal and abstract

If one lover says sadly to the other: "We shall always be as far apart as we are now; we meet only in illusion," the figure is drawn from geometry and the rule is: let lives travel in straight lines; while the conclusion is: since our lives are parallel, we shall never meet. And it is a commonplace that such lines seem to converge at the horizon. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq2q4cq1s4z3yaw2fpav916y)</span>

If metaphor is a sign of genius, as Aristotle argued, it is because, by means of metaphor, the artist is able to organize whole areas of human thought and feeling, and to organize them concretely, giving to his model the quality of sensuous display. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq2qhbmn7hxa2vbwqbyvczba)</span>

> when the Consul falls over in the road, the concreteness of the scene presented should keep us to the concreteness of our own, each immediate and personal yet as shared as breathing, so \Ve don't dare make a mean abstraction of it, crying out as though we were critics : ah, look, the fall of man! oh, feel again the foolish frailties of flesh ! or, dear me, how hard life is to mount, how slow to summit! (all such shouts are vulgar and may rouse the Consul from his swoon before the proper words do); rather we see our own life in the same fashion Lowry has envisioned Firn1in's; what we take a way and keep is the novel's figurative form; we reconceive our own acts in his manner; hear, in our own ears, similar symbolic tones; and finally everything becomes clear-clear, that is, in terms of one quite bent and dirty toenail, since on another toe there n1ight not be Carthaginians in combat, but Buicks broken down, or disgraced angels falling into Indiana. The object of that mousy metaphor was Clifford; the object of every novel is its reader. And when the metaphor is meant, we look for Clifford's tail; and when the metaphor is apt, we find it. The novel does the same thing to uï¿½; there is no point it does not touch. Certainly details - are different. Clifford hasn't a real tail either. Nor does Hamlet's wind bark. What would make the metaphor if they \Vere just the same? <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq2r4jnmyt064eaz5cm337kq)</span>

> But you remember how Kant ingeniously solved his problem. Our own minds and our sensory equipment organize our world ; it is we who establish these a priori connections \vhich we later discover and son1etimes describe, n1istakenly, as natural laws. We are inveterate model makers, imposing on the pure data of sense a rigorously abstract system. The novelist makes a system for us too, although his is composed of a host of particulars, arranged to comply with esthetic conditions, and it both flatters and dismays us when we look at our own life through it because our life appears holy and beautiful always, even when tragic and ruthlessly fated. Still for us it is only "as if." Small comfort for Clifford, the n1etaphorical mouse. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq2rdtfp2n61n8fntwygq5ss)</span>
