## Highlights
> Obsidian can have multiple notes open side by side at the same time, making it very easy to switch between **plot notes, character profiles, research and the manuscript itself**. Scrivener does this too, but Obsidian does it better, especially with the sliding panes plugin enabled. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zmv1w0hdapvqkvw0f6q01))

> [!Example] Quote
> Bidirectional linking encourages nonlinear thinking by connecting ideas and concepts across different notes. This has been great for generating and developing story ideas! ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4znazfvp4kdg03gv2bt2dm))

> Creating an overview ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zrbarvxetjtqv95fky55z))

> Let’s jump into how I manage my stories in Obsidian. My folder structure, inspired by [Eleanor Konik](https://www.eleanorkonik.com), is ordered by degrees of done-ness from top to bottom: *seeds* are story ideas, *indices* are home notes for novel-length projects, *longform* contains actual scenes and chapters, *metatext* contains everything else that isn’t the actual manuscript like plot notes and character profiles. *In progress* and *finished* are for short stories and *archive* for stories that might be unfinished but that I’m not actively working on at the moment. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zptskkq02wvhqg4t21pag))

> I hardly ever go into these folders though. Instead, I have a story dashboard created with the [dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) that allows me to see two things at a glance: stories I am working on at the moment (denoted by a specific tag and ordered so that the most recent one is always on top) and story seeds (ordered by file size so I can see which one is most fleshed out). This is where I go when I want to work on *something* but don’t have anything specific in mind. Sometimes just going through the list and poking at older ideas is enough for me to get inspired.

> With everything in one place, it is ridiculously easy to work on multiple stories at the same time too. I never feel like I have nothing to work on anymore. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zqyqzzp2pf28xmes7dkac))

> Story notes and writing in Obsidian ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zrmcx94km5rkw7z0rm9qz))

> Short stories I usually keep in one or two note files (one for plot notes, one for the actual story). Longer projects get a home note with bidirectional links to all other relevant notes. My current home note template was adapted from how I used to structure projects in Scrivener. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zrmvb5gvdbamgrdd49enr))

> My scene template is fairly simple with a short summary, status (do I have preliminary notes or pieces of dialogue for it, is it in progress or finished?) and of course the project it belongs to. I only add the scene summary shortly before or while writing the scene in question. It is not something I plot beforehand, but rather something I use to get a better overview and that I can reference during revision and editing.

> It is possible to track other metadata such as which characters appear or are mentioned in the scene, where and when it takes place etc. While I personally see no value in doing that for my projects, I do *link* the relevant character profile when a character’s name is mentioned in the scene for the first time but not every time they are named. If I have dedicated notes for places or even specific concepts, I also link those when mentioned. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zxvmsct1r1t091kscfxck))

> My pre-writing process is fairly straightforward with little variation from project to project.
> 1. Idea gathering, fleshing out of central concept(s), atmosphere and key characters. I get more and more (vague) ideas on what should happen in the story and when. The shape of the idea also tells me whether it should be a short story, a novel or something else.
> 2. When I start seeing a plot emerge, I often check my ideas against some sort of story structure like the three acts or Save the Cat beat sheet. More often than not the entire plot starts falling into place and leaves me with a *rough* bullet-point summary of 500–2000 words. At this point, the beginning is the most detailed and I might have a few ideas for side plot. For the end, I usually know what needs to happen but not yet how the characters will get there.
> 3. Sometimes I do [plot embryos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pZ3ZZd1mms) for the main characters at this point. I might also do them in the middle of the first draft or after the first draft to clarify character development though. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4zyw2ynjv574dhxgzm8wee))

> This is how my plot note (currently at 1300 words) for an interactive story called *Ghostly* is structured. The three branches are story options the reader must choose between in the first scene, but you could also imagine them as plot points.

> And this is the plot note (currently at 500 words) for the novel I am currently working on. This one really only contains 2–3 bullet points for each of the six stages but I am expecting it to grow as I keep working on the story. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk501pzk5bt75t91rev90370))

> For me, the first draft is still about exploration and discovery but with a rough map to keep me on track and keep the final destination in sight. Sometimes I already have notes and dialogue for a few scenes before I ‘officially’ start writing. Either way, I try to ease myself into it and have at least a few breadcrumbs in place to combat that blank page phobia. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk504z4ft318t97fnmf94xw6))

> I write (mostly) chronologically and will adjust my plot summary as I discover more details and get ideas for the rest of the story. At some point, usually around two thirds of the way through, I connect all the dots and ‘discover’ how to get to the end. As mentioned before, I also add brief one-sentence summaries to all chapters or scenes as I go which comes in handy during revision. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk505c65qt755ksjwpdjyj9t))
