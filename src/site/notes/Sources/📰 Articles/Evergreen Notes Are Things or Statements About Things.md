# Evergreen Notes Are Things or Statements About Things

## Highlights

> Many evergreen notes should be statements with a clear opinion. That's because it forces you to really think about what you're trying to say. However, these "clear opinions" need "clear things" to talk about! What are these "things"?
> - *Concepts*: which can and should stand on their own
> - *Known Things*: "The magna carta was signed in 1215"
> - *Standards*: Things with a pre-set language (whether that's programming, Things that follow a process, manuals, etc
> 	 - examples include anything from mathematical formulas, to the basics of language, to the process of putting a bike together
> - *Definitions, terms, topics, persons, places, or generally any other nouns.*
> 
> These THING-based notes will naturally spawn ideas of your own that have clear opinions (or statements). For example:
> - The note on the `[[Magna Carta]]` (Clear Thing) can then link to a personalized note titled `[[No one is above the law]]` (Clear Opinion), which could link to another note titled `[[Protests can invoke radical change]]` (Clear Opinion).
> - A note on `[[Defining a variable]]` (Clear Thing) can link to a personalized note on `[[Understanding variables leads to higher level thinking]]` (Clear Opinion).
> - A note on the concept `[[Like begets like]]` (kinda both Clear Opinion and Fact) can link to the opinion `[[The neural formation of habits are additive]]` (Clear Opinion) and a bunch of other notes. See this example below:

> In this way, Thing-based notes are sturdy dots that we can then connect to Opinion-based notes through the natural process of note-making.
> There seem to be "things" and "opinion about things", and it's nice to have both. The "things" act as pillars ofâ€”or waypoints toâ€”acquired knowledge. Guiding markers and reminders. The things are the latticework upon which our "opinions about things" can hang. I suspect a healthy PKM system needs a balance of both.
