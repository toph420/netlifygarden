## Highlights
### id698523940

> machines, which were very expensive and hence could be bought only by big capitalists, altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former workers, because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyxp5j6t0w87hraf41zsqnx)</span>

> i) The class of big capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost exclusive possession of all the means of subsistance and of the instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for the production of the means of subsistence. This is the bourgeois class, or the bourgeoisie.
> (ii) The class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the class of proletarians, or the proletariat. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyxvbdxjjr37n79fvzdw8xc)</span>

### id698524758 Labor is a commodity

> Labor is a commodity, like any other, and its price is therefore determined by exactly the same laws that apply to other commodities. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyxz2gfa3fs3e9a0frz0pk1)</span>

### id698524867

> The proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor and does not draw profit from any kind of capital; whose weal and woe, whose life and death, whose sole existence depends on the demand for labor <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyy0n8kspn1vp6csrhm3t2n)</span>

### id698524998

> The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyy2ye16bgn8qptfezzv866)</span>

### id698525204

> The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyy5drxm7sn0ra90pzmjepk)</span>

### id698525418

> In short, by one route or another, he gets into the owning class and enters into competition. The proletarian liberates himself by abolishing competition, private property, and all class differences. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyy7qg7ez17y3yn2gywqq0d)</span>

- [N] Regarding Serfs

### id698525561

> The handicraftsman therefore frees himself by becoming either bourgeois or entering the middle class in general, or becoming a proletarian because of competition (as is now more often the case). In which case he can free himself by joining the proletarian movement, i.e., the more or less communist movement. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyyaryct2vgzqyafcfsfrj1)</span>

### id698525634

> The manufacturing worker is torn out of his patriarchal relation by big industry, loses whatever property he still has, and in this way becomes a proletarian. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyybvxq9csfejdebj84vjfz)</span>

- [N] Historically they had their looms and machines but big industry took that from them

### id698526047

> The introduction of free competition is thus public declaration that from now on the members of society are unequal only to the extent that their capitals are unequal, that capital is the decisive power, and that therefore the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, have become the first class in society. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyyk6e68vkyxqa46caf7mk5)</span>

### id698526824

> everywhere the proletariat develops in step with the bourgeoisie. In proportion, as the bourgeoisie grows in wealth, the proletariat grows in numbers. For, since the proletarians can be employed only by capital, and since capital extends only through employing labor, it follows that the growth of the proletariat proceeds at precisely the same pace as the growth of capital. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyyq880mmpet7c2wfz9ctjb)</span>

### id698527015

> Ever since the beginning of this (19th) century, the condition of industry has constantly fluctuated between periods of prosperity and periods of crisis; nearly every five to seven years, a fresh crisis has intervened, always with the greatest hardship for workers, and always accompanied by general revolutionary stirrings and the direct peril to the whole existing order of things. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyywzrgc5yghx29rzxy1chz)</span>

- [N] Related to surplus, need

### id698527321

> either that big industry must itself be given up, which is an absolute impossibility, or that it makes unavoidably necessary an entirely new organization of society in which production is no longer directed by mutually competing individual industrialists but rather by the whole society operating according to a definite plan and taking account of the needs of all. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyz0zjfsq112h4r9212cs6n)</span>

### id698527393

> That big industry, and the limitless expansion of production which it makes possible, bring within the range of feasibility a social order in which so much is produced that every member of society will be in a position to exercise and develop all his powers and faculties in complete freedom. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyz2gkbe3fq9cqqgsqvtkqt)</span>

### id698527416

> We see with the greatest clarity:
> (i) That all these evils are from now on to be ascribed solely to a social order which no longer corresponds to the requirements of the real situation; and
> (ii) That it is possible, through a new social order, to do away with these evils altogether. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyz3k340ahcsapp7ae3c813)</span>

### id698527450

> Above all, it will have to take the control of industry and of all branches of production out of the hands of mutually competing individuals, and instead institute a system in which all these branches of production are operated by society as a whole – that is, for the common account, according to a common plan, and with the participation of all members of society.
> It will, in other words, abolish competition and replace it with association. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyz4q96gtbt255byzpmgyn4)</span>

- [N] Taking over the means of production [[Means of Production\|Means of Production]]

### id698527555

> Private property must, therefore, be abolished and in its place must come the common utilization of all instruments of production and the distribution of all products according to common agreement – in a word, what is called the communal ownership of goods. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyz6rdw091tz2qxtj99btz3)</span>

- [N] Shortest and most significant way to characterize the revolution 

### id698529292 The abolition of private property is not only possible, but necessary

> Capital and the forces of production have been expanded to an unprecedented extent, and the means are at hand to multiply them without limit in the near future. Moreover, the forces of production have been concentrated in the hands of a few bourgeois, while the great mass of the people are more and more falling into the proletariat, their situation becoming more wretched and intolerable in proportion to the increase of wealth of the bourgeoisie. And finally, these mighty and easily extended forces of production have so far outgrown private property and the bourgeoisie, that they threaten at any moment to unleash the most violent disturbances of the social order. Now, under these conditions, the abolition of private property has become not only possible but absolutely necessary. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyzdqvsbt5z1fknywrmqr1v)</span>

- [N] God damn, preach brother! 

### id698529857

> In all probability, the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyzhkmq2y14qtqt797t78js)</span>

- [N] When surplus exists then private property can finally no longer exist 

### id698530643 The measures to enact Communism

> The main measures, emerging as the necessary result of existing relations, are the following:
> (i) Limitation of private property through progressive taxation, heavy inheritance taxes, abolition of inheritance through collateral lines (brothers, nephews, etc.) forced loans, etc.
> (ii) Gradual expropriation of landowners, industrialists, railroad magnates and shipowners, partly through competition by state industry, partly directly through compensation in the form of bonds.
> (iii) Confiscation of the possessions of all emigrants and rebels against the majority of the people.
> (iv) Organization of labor or employment of proletarians on publicly owned land, in factories and workshops, with competition among the workers being abolished and with the factory owners, in so far as they still exist, being obliged to pay the same high wages as those paid by the state.
> (v) An equal obligation on all members of society to work until such time as private property has been completely abolished. Formation of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
> (vi) Centralization of money and credit in the hands of the state through a national bank with state capital, and the suppression of all private banks and bankers.
> (vii) Increase in the number of national factories, workshops, railroads, ships; bringing new lands into cultivation and improvement of land already under cultivation – all in proportion to the growth of the capital and labor force at the disposal of the nation.
> (viii) Education of all children, from the moment they can leave their mother’s care, in national establishments at national cost. Education and production together.
> (ix) Construction, on public lands, of great palaces as communal dwellings for associated groups of citizens engaged in both industry and agriculture and combining in their way of life the advantages of urban and rural conditions while avoiding the one-sidedness and drawbacks of each.
> (x) Destruction of all unhealthy and jerry-built dwellings in urban districts.
> (xi) Equal inheritance rights for children born in and out of wedlock.
> (xii) Concentration of all means of transportation in the hands of the nation. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyzvt875rbtvsarj3csxpfm)</span>

- [N] Wow, he really laid it out there in clear terms. I’m baffled that we have not been able to enforce/enact these principles

### id698530778

> when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyzzkbt12pf5wvdtkp1w5p6)</span>

- [N] Based as fuck

### id698530909 A Communist revolution will not happen nationally, but universally

> It is a universal revolution and will, accordingly, have a universal range. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz02ty0kfeeeyek2mk2vma2)</span>

### id698530941

> Society will take all forces of production and means of commerce, as well as the exchange and distribution of products, out of the hands of private capitalists and will manage them in accordance with a plan based on the availability of resources and the needs of the whole society. In this way, most important of all, the evil consequences which are now associated with the conduct of big industry will be abolished. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz03s55pstkfrn0dzpw1dhh)</span>

### id698531124

> Instead of generating misery, overproduction will reach beyond the elementary requirements of society to assure the satisfaction of the needs of all; it will create new needs and, at the same time, the means of satisfying them. It will become the condition of, and the stimulus to, new progress, which will no longer throw the whole social order into confusion, as progress has always done in the past. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz057g2q10cegbcxgfhvyhx)</span>

- [N] Interesting, discussion of “new needs”

### id698531353

> People will no longer be, as they are today, subordinated to a single branch of production, bound to it, exploited by it; they will no longer develop *one* of their faculties at the expense of all others; they will no longer know only *one* branch, or one branch of a single branch, of production as a whole. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0a3qsaks07zdrj74cga60)</span>

### id698531394

> Industry controlled by society as a whole, and operated according to a plan, presupposes well-rounded human beings, their faculties developed in balanced fashion, able to see the system of production in its entirety. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0ajrk385f63n6vv0tspff)</span>

### id698531482

> society organized on a communist basis is incompatible with the existence of classes on the one hand, and that the very building of such a society provides the means of abolishing class differences on the other. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0ctzjfbgj12rsdjg12sm9)</span>

### id698531517

> Education will enable young people quickly to familiarize themselves with the whole system of production and to pass from one branch of production to another in response to the needs of society or their own inclinations. It will, therefore, free them from the one-sided character which the present-day division of labor impresses upon every individual. Communist society will, in this way, make it possible for its members to put their comprehensively developed faculties to full use <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0dm2jsj60zkp2zf8gdv8c)</span>

- [N] Education leads to one finding their passions and contributing in their own way

### id698531802

> The management of agriculture and industry by the same people rather than by two different classes of people is, if only for purely material reasons, a necessary condition of communist association. The dispersal of the agricultural population on the land, alongside the crowding of the industrial population into the great cities, is a condition which corresponds to an undeveloped state of both agriculture and industry and can already be felt as an obstacle to further development. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0hvg5cqzk7vsgs8vfcpvp)</span>

- [N] Interesting point. We regard rural and urban areas as entirely separate, but this shouldn’t be the case. 

### id698532554 Communism will bring about the disappearance of religion

> communism is the stage of historical development which makes all existing religions superfluous and brings about their disappearance <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0p8bx7v1b1jv592e7vw8a)</span>

- [N] lol burned religion 

### id698532800

> Communists must unremittingly struggle against these bourgeois socialists because they work for the enemies of communists and protect the society which communists aim to overthrow. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0th2h3ske5njeqzsbgcdy)</span>

- [N] Beginning to understand the unwillingness to work WITH ie democratic socialists, they’re perpetuating the system which communists want to topple

### id698532953

> in moments of action, the communists will have to come to an understanding with these democratic socialists, and in general to follow as far as possible a common policy with them – provided that these socialists do not enter into the service of the ruling bourgeoisie and attack the communists. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz0zf63jpbb4tevzj88x4y7)</span>

- [N] Ok so working with democratic socialists is not entirely off the table, in fact it’s important to work with them as far as necessary as long as they don’t plan to attack the goals of the communists 

### id698533283

> Since the communists cannot enter upon the decisive struggle between themselves and the bourgeoisie until the bourgeoisie is in power, it follows that it is in the interest of the communists to help the bourgeoisie to power as soon as possible in order the sooner to be able to overthrow it <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz1509j4jy2ebktbd5359g2)</span>

- [N] Very interesting, it’s necessary for the bourgeois to be in power before it can be over thrown, and even assisting them to this power may be necessary 

### id698533477

> The sole advantages which the proletariat would derive from a bourgeois victory would consist
> (i) in various concessions which would facilitate the unification of the proletariat into a closely knit, battle-worthy, and organized class; and
> (ii) in the certainly that, on the very day the absolute monarchies fall, the struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat will start. From that day on, the policy of the communists will be the same as it now is in the countries where the bourgeoisie is already in power. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsz19ctnskmy6egx397mtc5m)</span>
