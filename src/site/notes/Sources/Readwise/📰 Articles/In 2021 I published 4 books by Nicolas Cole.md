## Highlights

### Writing a Book is a 5 Step process

> #### Step 1: Atomize
> If you think of a book as a huge wall of text, writing feels heavy.
> But if you think of a book as lots of small sections stacked on top of each other (like LEGOs), writing feels easy.
> 12 chapter / 60k words = 5k words per chapter.
> That's a long-form blog post. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk5a5jgf2wx9t02047bav1e8))
> 
> #### Step 2: Organize
> Within each of these 12 chapters, make a list of all the Main Points you want to make.
> - Chapter = Topic 
> - Chapter Outline = Everything you want to say about that topic
> - Don't bother w/ sentences yet.
> - Just list out ideas/opinions/points. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk5a5q1rfv4ayhz25dw2at2d))
> 
> #### Step 3: Synthesize
> After you've listed Main Points in each of the 12 chapters, go back through and look for:
> -Repeating points (don't inflate word count saying the same thing twice)  
> - Conflicting points ("You said X here, but Y there?") 
> - Disorganized points (wrong chapter) ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk5a5t467xmde87xbbmee3jb))
> 
> #### Step 4: Jazzercise
>   Now that you have all your Main Points in the right chapters, start free flowing.
>   If you did it right, writing should feel like you're coloring inside the lines (section by section) opposed to painting on a blank canvas.
>   Organized containers = faster writing ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk5a5xq791jvcb88999wt0n7))
> 
> #### Step 5: Crystallize
> You should only get "in the weeds" and start line-editing once you've:
> - Organized big ideas into 12 chapters
> - Listed Main Points inside each chapter 
> - Free-flowed inside each Main Point inside each chapter
> - Final editing should be quick and easy. ([👁](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk5a61eh8q784fam14w3hexq))
