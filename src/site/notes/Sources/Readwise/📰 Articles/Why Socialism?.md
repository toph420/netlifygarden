# Why Socialism?

## Highlights

> Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society. <span class='highlight-link'>[üîó](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw3jhfwq2b0rews1xxr4r27j)</span>

> The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor‚Äînot by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production‚Äîthat is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods‚Äîmay legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals. <span class='highlight-link'>[üîó](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw3jk3bdx5k6vm1bbx1h0hbc)</span>

> Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights. <span class='highlight-link'>[üîó](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw3jr0msqh9zxhcr4nnmyvpz)</span>

> Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an ‚Äúarmy of unemployed‚Äù almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers‚Äô goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before. <span class='highlight-link'>[üîó](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw3jxejykg1ffak4vrw8ye4n)</span>

> I am convinced there is only *one* way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society. <span class='highlight-link'>[üîó](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw3k0zr7pws0wny1pjz0ak74)</span>
