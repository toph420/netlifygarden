> The rock upon which the best economists were stranded, as long as they started out from the value of labour, vanishes as soon as we make our starting-point the value oflabour-power. Labour-power is, in our present-day capitalist society, a commodity like every other commodity, but yet a very peculiar commodity. It has, namely, the peculiarity of being a value-creating force, the source of value, and, moreover, when properly treated, the source of more value than it possesses itself. In the present state of production, human labour-power not only produces in a day a greater value than it itself possesses and costs; but with each new scientific discovery, with each new technical invention, there also rises the surplus of its daily production over its daily cost, while as a consequence there diminishes that part of the working-day in which the labourer produces the equivalent of his dayâ€™s wages, and, on the other hand, lengthens that part of the working-day in which he must present labour gratis to the capitalist. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htd731by4f0tgaxt8cc92v4m)</span>

> We thus see that the price of a commodity is indeed determined by its cost of production, but in such a manner that the periods in which the price of these commodities rises above the costs of production are balanced by the periods in which it sinks below the cost of production, and vice versa. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdfjpsd72jg4tyhs6pzskpe)</span>


### id700974373

> The determination of price by cost of production is tantamount to the determination of price by the labour-time requisite to the production of a commodity, for the cost of production consists, first of raw materials and wear and tear of tools, etc., i.e., of industrial products whose production has cost a certain number of work-days, which therefore represent a certain amount of labour- time, and, secondly, of direct labour, which is also measured by its duration. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdfn6bt1fm62hh9j7kvkc7m)</span>

### id700975712

> Wages will now rise, now fall, according to the relation of supply and demand, according as competition shapes itself between the buyers of labour-power, the capitalists, and the sellers of labour-power, the workers. The fluctuations of wages correspond to the fluctuation in the price of commodities in general. But within the limits of these fluctuations the price of labour-power will be determined by the cost of production, by the labour-time necessary for production of this commodity: labour-power. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdfrf7gah3xcxgpdeervkv2)</span>

### id700977914

> In those branches of industry in which hardly any period of apprenticeship is necessary and the mere bodily existence of the worker is sufficient, the cost of his production is limited almost exclusively to the commodities necessary for keeping him in working condition. The price of his work will therefore be determined by the price of the necessary means of subsistence. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdfzzh41yw581exvns7rxe6)</span>

### id700978269

> Thus, the cost of production of simple labour-power amounts to the cost of the existence and propagation of the worker. The price of this cost of existence and propagation constitutes wages. The wages thus determined are called the minimum of wages. This minimum wage, like the determination of the price of commodities in general by cost of production, does not hold good for the single individual, but only for the race. Individual workers, indeed, millions of workers, do not receive enough to be able to exist and to propagate themselves; but the wages of the whole working class adjust themselves, within the limits of their fluctuations, to this minimum. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdg45qdnxftbvjb3x4ec3g7)</span>


### id700978700

> Capital consists of raw materials, instruments of labour, and means of subsistence of all kinds, which are employed in producing new raw materials, new instruments, and new means of subsistence. All these components of capital are created by labour, products of labour, accumulated labour. Accumulated labour that serves as a means to new production is capital.

### id700979401

> Capital also is a social relation of production. It is a bourgeois relation of production, a relation of production of bourgeois society. The means of subsistence, the instruments of labour, the raw materials, of which capital consists â€“ have they not been produced and accumulated under given social conditions, within definite special relations? Are they not employed for new production, under given special conditions, within definite social relations? And does not just the definite social character stamp the products which serve for new production as capital? <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdgj09f02w0efydkqregjfx)</span>

### id700979518

> Capital consists not only of means of subsistence, instruments of labour, and raw materials, not only as material products; it consists just as much of exchange values. All products of which it consists are commodities. Capital, consequently, is not only a sum of material products, it is a sum of commodities, of exchange values, of social magnitudes. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdgm5zgzre07ey96c5h6q3g)</span>

### id700980195

> The existence of a class which possesses nothing but the ability to work is a necessary presupposition of capital.
> It is only the dominion of past, accumulated, materialized labour over immediate living labour that stamps the accumulated labour with the character of capital.
> Capital does not consist in the fact that accumulated labour serves living labour as a means for new production. It consists in the fact that living labour serves accumulated labour as the means of preserving and multiplying its exchange value. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdh2bxycr0h1n7nxwcfwne8)</span>


### id706332154

> Capital can multiply itself only by exchanging itself for labour-power, by calling wage-labour into life. The labour-power of the wage-labourer can exchange itself for capital only by increasing capital, by strengthening that very power whose slave it is. Increase of capital, therefore, is increase of the proletariat, i.e., of the working class. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc89tj2gfaj2d38771n4ttt)</span>

### id706332710

> The worker perishes if capital does not keep him busy. Capital perishes if it does not exploit labour-power, which, in order to exploit, it must buy. The more quickly the capital destined for production â€“ the productive capital â€“ increases, the more prosperous industry is, the more the bourgeoisie enriches itself, the better business gets, so many more workers does the capitalist need, so much the dearer does the worker sell himself. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc8frdk6bea3k18e9hdtwmy)</span>

### id706334420

> In the 16th century, the gold and silver circulation in Europe increased in consequence of the discovery of richer and more easily worked mines in America. The value of gold and silver, therefore, fell in relation to other commodities. The workers received the same amount of coined silver for their labour-power as before. The money price of their work remained the same, and yet their wages had fallen, for in exchange for the same amount of silver they obtained a smaller amount of other commodities. This was one of the circumstances which furthered the growth of capital, the rise of the bourgeoisie, in the 18th century. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc943fvq554g11by1kw4ahe)</span>


### id706335247

> The money price of labour-power, the nominal wages, do not therefore coincide with the actual or real wages â€“ i.e., with the amount of commodities which are actually given in exchange for the wages. If then we speak of a rise or fall of wages, we have to keep in mind not only the money price of labour-power, the nominal wages, but also the real wages. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc9b6brvm36yrtwryhcss79)</span>


### id706335575

> Wages are determined above all by their relations to the gain, the profit, of the capitalist. In other words, wages are a proportionate, relative quantity.
> Real wages express the price of labour-power in relation to the price of commodities; relative wages, on the other hand, express the share of immediate labour in the value newly created by it, in relation to the share of it which falls to accumulated labour, to capital. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc9drw40dh74zepz7fycpjf)</span>

### id706335986

> The selling price of the commodities produced by the worker is divided, from the point of view of the capitalist, into three parts: First, the replacement of the price of the raw materials advanced by him, in addition to the replacement of the wear and tear of the tools, machines, and other instruments of labour likewise advanced by him; Second, the replacement of the wages advanced; and Third, the surplus leftover â€“ i.e., the profit of the capitalist. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc9jtx58thgqsjfwby2842v)</span>

### id706337023

> Profit, indeed, has not risen because wages have fallen, but wages have fallen because profit has risen. With the same amount of another man's labour the capitalist has bought a larger amount of exchange values without having paid more for the labour on that account â€“ i.e., the work is paid for less in proportion to the net gain which it yields to the capitalist. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvc9y0qxgbe70v3bvecfherc)</span>

### id706338608

> A rapid growth of capital is synonymous with a rapid growth of profits. Profits can grow rapidly only when the price of labour â€“ the relative wages â€“ decrease just as rapidly.

> Whatever be the power of the means of production which are employed, competition seeks to rob capital of the golden fruits of this power by reducing the price of commodities to the cost of production; in the same measure in which production is cheapened - i.e., in the same measure in which more can be produced with the same amount of labour â€“ it compels by a law which is irresistible a still greater cheapening of production, the sale of ever greater masses of product for smaller prices. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvcbe1607sc6wv8jktc1ea81)</span>

He becomes transformed into a simple monotonous force of production, with neither physical nor mental elasticity. His work becomes accessible to all; therefore competitors press upon him from all sides. Moreover, it must be remembered that the more simple, the more easily learned the work is, so much the less is its cost to production, the expense of its acquisition, and so much the lower must the wages sink â€“ for, like the price of any other commodity, they are determined by the cost of production.
