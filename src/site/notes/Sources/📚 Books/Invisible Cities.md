## Highlights

> The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp6c7an0dnh0psm64q81y8za)</span>

### id862773615

> The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp6ceqk1bjvv01zmyszzx50g)</span>

### id862776903

> The city appears to you as a whole where no desire is lost and of which you are a part, and since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing but inhabit this desire and be content. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp6ckzxf1pf6zbdjtfs8jxb0)</span>

### id862778250

> Your gaze scans the streets as if they were written pages: the city says everything you must think, makes you repeat her discourse, and while you believe you are visiting Tamara you are only recording the names with which she defines herself and all her parts. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp6ctezk7mkjsd7fq1gjycm2)</span>

### id862780120

> This city which cannot be expunged from the mind is like an armature, a honeycomb in whose cells each of us can place the things he wants to remember: names of famous men, virtues, numbers, vegetable and mineral classifications, dates of battles, constellations, parts of speech. Between each idea and each point of the itinerary an affinity or a contrast can be established, serving as an immediate aid to memory. So the world’s most learned men are those who have memorized Zora. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp6cy8tjw03p1yvqpcx6bmk8)</span>

> Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms.
> “On the day when I know all the emblems,” he asked Marco, “shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?”
> And the Venetian answered: “Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be an emblem among emblems.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb0vgxnwayhwtn8364z0s91)</span>

### id863492732

> Marco Polo imagined answering (or Kublai Khan imagined his answer) that the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there; and he retraced the stages of his journeys, and he came to know the port from which he had set sail, and the familiar places of his youth, and the surroundings of home, and a little square of Venice where he gamboled as a child. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb10gqjftgzhmvwfnw2tv0k)</span>

### id863492829

> “Journeys to relive your past?” was the Khan’s question at this point, a question which could also have been formulated: “Journeys to recover your future?”
> And Marco’s answer was: “Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb14vc8y63138ewt9mtr07h)</span>

### id863493632

> On the map of your empire, O Great Khan, there must be room both for the big, stone Fedora and the little Fedoras in glass globes. Not because they are all equally real, but because all are only assumptions. The one contains what is accepted as necessary when it is not yet so; the others, what is imagined as possible and, a moment later, is possible no longer. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb1b929wcq8c5wze78x1c4a)</span>

### id863528985

> it is pointless trying to decide whether Zenobia is to be classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb6a06eknkypf4yx9xb2h83)</span>

### id863532208

> With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb6ypyg0r05wzttb9h7kmdt)</span>

### id863532281

> “Cities also believe they are the work of the mind or of chance, but neither the one nor the other suffices to hold up their walls. You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.”
> “Or the question it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpb70pmm69cmakgnh0kgc9f9)</span>

> CITIES & DESIRE • 5
> FROM THERE, AFTER six days and seven nights, you arrive at Zobeide, the white city, well exposed to the moon, with streets wound about themselves as in a skein. They tell this tale of its foundation: men of various nations had an identical dream. They saw a woman running at night through an unknown city; she was seen from behind, with long hair, and she was naked. They dreamed of pursuing her. As they twisted and turned, each of them lost her. After the dream they set out in search of that city; they never found it, but they found one another; they decided to build a city like the one in the dream. In laying out the streets, each followed the course of his pursuit; at the spot where they had lost the fugitive’s trail, they arranged spaces and walls differently from the dream, so she would be unable to escape again.
> This was the city of Zobeide, where they settled, waiting for that scene to be repeated one night. None of them, asleep or awake, ever saw the woman again. The city’s streets were streets where they went to work every day, with no link any more to the dreamed chase. Which, for that matter, had long been forgotten.
> New men arrived from other lands, having had a dream like theirs, and in the city of Zobeide, they recognized something of the streets of the dream, and they changed the positions of arcades and stairways to resemble more closely the path of the pursued woman and so, at the spot where she had vanished, there would remain no avenue of escape.
> The first to arrive could not understand what drew these people to Zobeide, this ugly city, this trap. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpbnn5q329d0837yhq1myz05)</span>

- [N] Hypatia. This is an interesting story as well, a bit esoteric but beautiful

### id863572818

> A voluptuous vibration constantly stirs Chloe, the most chaste of cities. If men and women began to live their ephemeral dreams, every phantom would become a person with whom to begin a story of pursuits, pretenses, misunderstandings, clashes, oppressions, and the carousel of fantasies would stop. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpbp8r17vxmz9vty0msvbjf1)</span>

- [N] "Carousel of fantasies"

### id863572961

> Valdrada’s inhabitants know that each of their actions is, at once, that action and its mirror-image, which possesses the special dignity of images, and this awareness prevents them from succumbing for a single moment to chance and forgetfulness. Even when lovers twist their naked bodies, skin against skin, seeking the position that will give one the most pleasure in the other, even when murderers plunge the knife into the black veins of the neck and more clotted blood pours out the more they press the blade that slips between the tendons, it is not so much their copulating or murdering that matters as the copulating or murdering of the images, limpid and cold in the mirror. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpbpcwxy2snk6f7p05v5rhny)</span>

- [N] It's on the lake, mirrored
