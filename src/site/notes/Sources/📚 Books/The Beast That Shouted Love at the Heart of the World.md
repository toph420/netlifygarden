# The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World

## Thoughts

## Highlights
### id781762552

> Standing in the hotel window staring out at the Atlantic Ocean, nightcrashing onto the Copacabana beach. Down in Brazil on a fool’s mission, talking to myself. Standing in the window of a stranger whom I suddenly know well, while down the Avenida Atlantica in another window, one I know well, who has suddenly become a stranger. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j72m0bzxn02a18khd3jd2yxk)</span>

- [N] Highlighting the first paragraph of the book because it's stylistically so cool, uh oh

> I have drawn my parallels, have sighted down the gun, have sounded the clarion call. To what end?
> Perhaps to finally codify for myself what my stories have been saying for the last few years: that man is building for himself a darkness of world that is turning him mad; that the pressures are too great, the machines too often break down, and the alien alone cannot make it. We must think new thoughts, we must love as we have never even suspected we can love, and if there is honor to violence we must get it on at once, have done with it, try to live with our guilt for having so done, and move on. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j72mff860fpyazy4jtgnnh7n)</span>

- [N] Ellison tells us about his culmination of work, a brooding darkness of the world. I'm looking forward to this one.

### id781767554

> For the record, and for those who need to be told bluntly, I do not believe there is such a thing as “New Wave” in speculative fiction (any more than there is something labeled with the abhorrent abbreviation “sci-fi”, though I do not expect reviewers outside the genre to exercise enough taste to drop this convenient, though totally despicable, slang bastardization of a term presently unsuitable for that which the field has become). It is a convenient journalese expression for inept critics and voyeur-observers of the passing scene, because they have neither the wit nor the depth to understand that this richness of new voices is *many* waves: each composed of one writer. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j72n0qhj2paa42zd6a0hmk7g)</span>

- [N] Ellison calls out critics using "New Wave" to lump certain speculative fiction writers together, also calls out those using "sci fi"

### id781768296

> Yet there can be no denying that there is something happening: you don’t know what the hell it is, do you, Mr. Jones, but you know it’s happening, so you call it New Wave, and that makes it easier to feel uneasy about, can you dig it, Mr. Jones? <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j72n3fet4z8svtwnsd338x60)</span>

> (Today, the person who out-of-hand denies anything experimental because it *is* experimental, is not even considered square; he’s merely pathetic. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j72n4rwn3gp0g36w22eea487)</span>

### id781768819

> The fuddy-duddy yesterday can certainly be revered, for it contains the roots of our heritage in the form. But to revere is one thing, to totemize is another. To expect to hold up the future merely to let ghosts of yesterday feed on a today they don’t own, is encystment. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j72nak8jpn18cz3s7ymk865m)</span>

### id781771735

> I suppose, then, that the bottom line of what I’ve rambled on about here, ties the stories in with what I felt in Rio (and with “waves”, of all kinds): the stories that are merely stories—what Vonnegut calls *foma*, harmless untruths—are for entertainment. The others are to tell you that as night approaches we are *all* aliens, down here on this alien Earth. To tell you that not Christ nor man nor governments of men will save you. To tell you that writers about tomorrow must stop living in yesterday and work from their hearts and their guts and their courage to tell us about tomorrow, before all the tomorrows are stolen away from us. To tell you no one will come down from the mountain to save your lily-white hide or your black ass. God is within you. Save yourselves.
> Otherwise, why would you have traveled all this way…just to be alone?

- [N] 4/5 Wow, this story is an insane non-linear ride, as he describes, "circular"... the scenes he throws together in such a quick span of time are mind shattering. Serial killer rampage, 7 headed dragon gets the insanity drained from it by and for a future species in order to satisfy the Concord (a celestial congress of birds), atilla the hun not attacking Rome, the statue on the far off planet that's both the serial killer and the drainer guy, and a nutjob that gets blasted with the purple essence of the insanity matter. Huh?!

- [N] 4/5 awesome action packed futuristic road rage scenario. George is a family man, but this young punk is gonna get it. He calls in to request a legal duel and permission is granted. Surprisingly he pulls it off, just barely, he takes out the top dog and now the others are after him.

- [N] 2.75/5 A quick adventure through the desert with 4 people, one dead at the start, 2 annoying our main character, one an ex, the other her husband. They trek to find a city that's supposedly rising from the sands, a sign of previous generations of humans. Beasts descend upon them, mutants, she dies and the two men left discover the city, the other guy dies and our MC finds New York, rising from the sands. He takes some relics and heads back to Atlantis. A fine story with some cool imagery and lines, but bleak as hell and underwhelming.

> The sun hung above us like a great eye, punched by a sharp flaming stick…a bloody, dripping eye that turned the stinking desert red around us. Illogically, I wanted a good cup of coffee.
> Water. I wanted water, too. And lemonade. With ice all the way up to the top of the glass. Ice cream. Maybe on a stick. I shook my head…I was buzzing. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j750hachvbffeqtdc11h3cm5)</span>
