# The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch

## Thoughts

## Highlights

> I mean, after all; you have to consider we’re only made out of dust. That’s admittedly not much to go on and we shouldn’t forget that. But even considering, I mean it’s a sort of bad beginning, we’re not doing too bad. So I personally have faith that even in this lousy situation we’re faced with we can make it. You get me? <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6x952bc7k46h7e7xfz7zs4j)</span>

### id777914144

> In the miserably high-number conapt building 492 on the outskirts of Marilyn Monroe, New Jersey, Richard Hnatt ate breakfast indifferently while, with something greater than indifference, he glanced over the morning homeopape’s weather-syndrome readings of the previous day. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6xa6z68repp2y4wknxcj0ga)</span>

- [N] Just an awesome establishing scene 

### id781295372

> And there’s no pressure I can put on the UN to exempt him.
> And simply because I supply those colonists with their Can-D, he said to himself. I mean, somebody has to; they’ve got to have it. Otherwise what good are the Perky Pat layouts to them?
> And in addition it was one of the most profitable trading operations in the Sol system. Many truffle skins were involved.
> The UN knew that, too. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zx16x72capyyvjh63g2ky2)</span>

- [N] Can-D? Perky Pat Layouts? Truffle Skins? The UN? Oh we're in for a ride...

### id781295947

> You can’t make healthy people sick just by giving an order.
> *Or can you?* <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zx5q0809agwkggqm4skm58)</span>

### id781296487

> in concert the users’ minds fused, became a new unity–or at least that was the experience. A few sessions of Can-D chewing in togetherness and he would know all there was to know about Pia Jurgens; <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zx9trcyxj7qmyd05b0azd5)</span>

- [N] Can-D effects

### id781298052

> By an irony he, the creator and manufacturer of the Perky Pat microworld, preferred to use Can-D in a vacuum; what did a Terran have to gain from a layout, inasmuch as it was a mill of the conditions obtaining in the average Terran city? For settlers on a howling, gale-swept moon, huddled at the bottom of a hovel against frozen methane crystals and things, it was something else again; Perky Pat and her layout were an entree back to the world they had been born to. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zxby4q4ydgkr25wxc074zs)</span>

- [N] So a layout is like a setting that you experience while under the influence of Can-D?

### id781299593

> Opening his desk drawer he got out his box of Cuesta Reys, the very finest; he offered the box to Miss Fugate, who gratefully accepted one of the slender dark cigars. He, too, took a cigar; he lit hers and then his, and leaned back in his chair. “You know who Palmer Eldritch is?” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zxqaqr6rdt4g8wb1yne6pn)</span>

- [N] Love the vibes in this story

### id781300044

> Miss Fugate whispered, “The headlines say that Palmer Eldritch is dead.” She blinked, looked around her with amazement, then slowly focused on him; she regarded him with a confused mixture of fear and uncertainty, almost palpably edging back; she retreated from him, huddled against her chair, her fingers interlocked. “And you’re accused of having done it, Mr. Bulero. Honest; that’s what the headline says.”
> “You mean I’m going to *murder* him?” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zxvzhydan2q3q7zbqc94hd)</span>

- [N] Love the pre-cogs, they were in Ubik as well. Such a cool technology, or biology I guess. 

### id781300584

> But his curiosity was aroused. In all his manifold operations he had never found the need of killing anyone under any circumstances. Whatever it was that would occur between him and Palmer Eldritch had to be unique; definitely a trip to Ganymede was indicated. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zy6xmk2jk2gh4aq9gefr7q)</span>

- [N] Ms. Fugate is playing her cards right with Leo Bulero. She foresees that he kills Eldritch Palmer and gets accused of murder. Well now he just has to know what all the fuss is about. Ms. Fugate decides to use this information to coax her way into a new position, making a deal with Leo to get Mayerson drafted so she can take his job. And what's a bubblehead?

### id781302017

> He offered Hnatt the stack of brown, wrinkled, truffle-skins which served as tender in the Sol system: the only molecule, a unique protein amino acid, which could not be duplicated by the Printers, the Biltong life forms employed in place of automated assembly lines by many of Terra’s industries. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6zzbzeps2awgjamdwtt659g)</span>

- [N] Truffle Skins are currency in the Sol System

### id781303891

> He himself was a believer; he affirmed the miracle of translation–the near-sacred moment in which the miniature artifacts of the layout no longer merely represented Earth but *became* Earth. And he and the others, joined together in the fusion of doll-inhabitation by means of the Can-D, were transported outside of time and local space. Many of the colonists were as yet unbelievers; to them the layouts were merely symbols of a world which none of them could any longer experience. But, one by one, the unbelievers came around. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7000b4vtgnyx937jevpqgkk)</span>

- [N] Oh now we're getting weird. This dude, Sam Regan, is a real Can-D fiend.

### id781304767

> Without looking up, Fran said, “We’ve got Perky Pat all the way downtown in her new Ford hardtop convert and parked and a dime in the meter and she’s shopped and now she’s in the analyst’s office reading *Fortune*. But what does she pay?” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j700e4fr8kb2q94cm1nmhq7w)</span>

- [N] So Perky Pat is like a Barbie type figure that humans live vicariously through, saving their truffle skins to purchase all these miniature items, and hoping to experience the mini worlds from far off planets and stars through the drug called Can-D. Amazing.

### id781305237

> Although some–*not in this hovel*-claimed that the power to insure translation did not come from the Can-D but from the accuracy of the layout. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j700jzqwqy069068hjm361ay)</span>

### id781306062

> “I believe,” Fran said slowly, as she disengaged her fingers from his and stood by the hall door of the compartment, “that whether it’s a play of imagination, of drug-induced hallucination, or an actual translation from Mars to Earth-as-it-was by an agency we know nothing of–” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j700nme1j389ebtqzcqghamb)</span>

### id781306181

> “It should be a purifying experience. We lose our fleshly bodies, our corporeality, as they say. And put on imperishable bodies instead, for a time anyhow. Or forever, if you believe as some do that it’s outside of time and space, that it’s eternal. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j700qd6xg543paawpbz7s4y5)</span>

### id781306394

> “Spirituality,” he said with disgust as he fished up the packet of Can-D from its cavity beneath the compartment. “A denial of reality, and what do you get instead? Nothing.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j700t3n6tx48zbqs8h788hsm)</span>

### id781307864

> While translated one could commit incest, murder, anything, and it remained from a juridical standpoint a mere fantasy, an impotent wish only. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j700ypwmm389m7sd3vm4abqn)</span>

- [N] Fran is Orthodox, as is the majority of people, and believes that through death we let go of our sin. Sam on the other hand chews Can-D to gain something, something they are not normally entitled to.

### id781308468

> It was always Saturday. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j70175cycqjsgx6t89r9j2n6)</span>

### id781309526

> We should try to obtain as much from this as possible. Our time is short enough as it is… at least so it seems to me.” She smiled wanly. “So drive as fast as you can; I want to get to the ocean.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j701pw7cjsyybwk3na0hans2)</span>

### id781309948

> “We’re here,” she said presently, “to do what we can’t do back at the hovel. Back where we’ve left our corruptible bodies. As long as we keep our layouts in repair this–” She gestured at the ocean, then once more touched herself, unbelievingly. “It can’t decay, can it? We’ve put on immortality.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j701wkbdvmz7p1gkxjn5rb4s)</span>

### id781310207

> The waves of the ocean lapped at the two of them as they silently reclined together on the beach, two figures comprising the essences of six persons. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7022942x944c0ehfmnhxtp0)</span>

### id781310510

> We won after all, he thought as he deftly unhooked her bra, began to unbutton her shirt, unzipped her skirt, and removed her laceless slipperlike shoes in one swift operation; he was busy everywhere and Fran sighed, this time not wearily. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j70284f1q65eh0thbh31gx54)</span>

- [N] Sam and Fran escape into the layout only to be interrupted by the others, which in turn leads to them coming down from the Can-D earlier than the rest, allowing them to finish what they started and have sex. But do they still require the Can-D for this experience as well?

### id782126765

> He had with him a weapon so small, so intangible, that even the most thorough search couldn’t disclose it. Some time ago a surgeon at Washington, D.C. had sewn it into his tongue: a self-guiding, high-velocity poison dart, modeled on Soviet Russian lines… but vastly improved, in that once it had reached its victim it obliterated itself, leaving no remains. The poison, too, was original; it did not curtail heart or respiratory action; in fact it was not a poison but a filterable virus which multiplied in the victim’s blood stream, causing death within forty-eight hours. It was carcinomatous, an importation from one of Uranus’s moons, and still generally unknown; it had cost him a great deal. All he needed to do was stand within arm’s length of his intended victim and manually squeeze the base of his tongue, protruding the same simultaneously in the victim’s direction. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j752rgg4b5qcynetk922ewdw)</span>

- [N] Cool tiny tongue implant weapon of poison 

### id783224774

> “Called Chew-Z, with the slogan: *be choosy. Chew Chew-Z*.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a23kj7mqxrme8vbk30jste)</span>

### id783230146

> Below lay the tomb world, the immutable cause-and-effect world of the demonic. At median extended the layer of the human, but at any instant a man could plunge–descend as if sinking–into the hell-layer beneath. Or: he could ascend to the ethereal world above, which constituted the third of the trinary layers. Always, in his middle level of the human, a man risked the sinking. And yet the possibility of ascent lay before him; any aspect or sequence of reality *could become either*, at any instant. Hell and heaven, not after death but now! Depression, all mental illness, was the sinking. And the other… how was it achieved?
> Through empathy. Grasping another, not from outside but from the inner. For example, had he ever really looked at Emily’s pots as anything more than merchandise for which a market existed? No. What I ought to have seen in them, he realized, is the artistic intention, the spirit she’s revealing intrinsically. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a3hgmkc0knzknqrtvf2gg8)</span>

- [N] Barney is evolving, having insights about decisions he's made, noting how he needs to be more empathetic.

### id783233588

> “I’ve discussed your dilemma with Mr. Mayerson and he will contact Felix Blau as you requested. Mr. Mayerson thinks he recalls reading in a homeopape once about a UN camp much as you are experiencing, somewhere in the Saturn region, for retarded children. Perhaps–” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a4fc4dh8gpq053475fn291)</span>

- [N] Lol. Is Bulero regressed?

### id783243928

> “God,” Eldritch said, “promises eternal life. I can do better; *I can deliver it*.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a6d32cqzqpnk6c0hr73gss)</span>

### id783244426

> “When we return to our former bodies–you notice the use of the word ‘former,’ a term you wouldn’t apply with Can-D, and for good reason–*you’ll find that no time has passed*. We could stay here fifty years and it’d be the same; we’d emerge back at the demesne on Luna and find everything unchanged, and anyone watching us would see no lapse of consciousness, as you have with Can-D, no trance, no stupor. Oh, maybe a flicker of the eyelids. A split second; I’m willing to concede that.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a6ng7g956qqtwy0dymk30p)</span>

- [N] Chew-Z drug effects

### id783244539

> You can reincarnate in any form you wish, or that’s wished for you, as in this situation.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a6qhtrp79rwjh68fw8xg6m)</span>

### id783244572

> “With Chew-Z one can pass from life to life, be a bug, a physics teacher, a hawk, a protozoon, a slime mold, a streetwalker in Paris in 1904, a–”
> “Even,” Leo said, “a gluck. Which one of us is the gluck, there?”
> “I told you; I made it out of a portion of myself. You could shape something. Go ahead–project a fraction of your essence; it’ll take material form on its own. What you supply is the logos. Remember that?” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a6r82q3cm86gm4780tbvgb)</span>

### id783245674

> “Because however wonderful being Perky Pat and Walt is for a while, eventually they’re forced to return to their hovels. Do you know how that feels, Leo? Try it sometime; wake up in a hovel on Ganymede after you’ve been freed for twenty, thirty minutes. It’s an experience you’ll never forget.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a6xxfhxfk50xfmzgqkh9f7)</span>

### id783245705

> When the little period of escape is over and the colonist returns… he’s not fit to resume a normal, daily life. He’s demoralized. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a6y9xgk4hdtsnwcm3m54nn)</span>

### id783246122

> “Take the medieval doctrine of substance versus accidents,” the child said pleasantly. “My accidents are those of this child, but my substance, as with the wine and the wafer in transubstantiation–” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a72j3ck3a3zmz0zfbgvkqj)</span>

### id783246250

> “Alone,” Leo said. “You mean each person goes to a different subjective world? It’s not like the layouts, then, because everyone in the group who takes Can-D goes to the layout, the men to Walt, the women into Perky Pat. But that means you’re not here.” Or, he thought, I’m not here. But in that case <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a74zpft12m5mhvj57sgscm)</span>

### id783247650

> Leo said, “Hey, Palmer.” His voice was uncontrolled, babylike with fear. “Hey, you know what? I give up; I really do.”
> The carpet of the office beneath his feet rotted, became mushy, and then sprouted, grew, alive, into green fibers; he saw that it was becoming grass. And then the walls and the ceiling caved in, collapsed into fine dust; the particles rained noiselessly down like ashes. And the blue, cool sky appeared, untouched, above.
> Seated on the grass, with the stick in her lap and the suitcase containing Dr. Smile beside her, Monica said, “Did you want Mr. Mayerson to remain? I didn’t think so. I let him go with the rest that you made. Okay?” She smiled up at Leo. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a7pffereatpch1djtf4a86)</span>

- [N] Trippy as frick

### id783248402

> “At this moment,” Dr. Smile explained, “Palmer Eldritch, although considerably upset and angered, is intravenously providing you with a substance which counters the injectable Chew-Z previously administered; you will return shortly.” It added, “That is, shortly, even instantly, in terms of the time-flow in that world. As to this–” It chuckled. “It could seem longer.”
> “*How* longer?”
> “Oh, years,” Dr. Smile said. “But quite possibly less. Days? Months? Time sense is subjective, so let’s see how it feels to you; do you not agree?” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a7zmzmqqbb44mb8bfrphz8)</span>

- [N] Ok this is scary. The antidote to get out of the hallucination could feel like years inside the irreal world, but instantly in actuality.

### id783249668

> Palmer Eldritch is an invader and this is how we’ll all wind up, here like this, on a plain of dead things that have become nothing more than random fragments; this is the “reincarnation” that he promised Hepburn-Gilbert. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7a85sp7ym6d0b24kxrhv931)</span>

- [N] Leo is captured by Palmer Eldritch and apparently given some Chew-Z in order to enter into a hallucinatory world that Palmer has created. He's on this artificial moon and he's "killed" Palmer, or a child placeholder of Palmer. He's told that he's been given an injection to remove him from the world but that it may take time. He runs into some future Terrans, they've evolved and they explain that he's a hero for killing Palmer Eldritch. Trippy as hell.

### id783637878

> The elevator had arrived, self-regulated; he stepped into it. “I’ll see you,” he said, and touched the button; the doors shut, cutting off his view of Roni. I’ll see you in what the Neo-Christians call hell, he thought to himself. Probably not before. Not unless this already is, and it may be, hell right now. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7cm69twd4vh921srx931s06)</span>

> “Why do you want to do that, for godssake?”
> “Then I can be back with Emily.”
> “Who’s Emily?”
> “My previous wife. Who I kicked out because she became pregnant. Now I realize it was the only happy time of my life. In fact I love her more now than I ever did; it’s grown instead of faded.”
> “Look,” Icholtz said. “We can supply you with all the Chew-Z you want and it’s superior; you can live forever in an eternal unchanging perfect now with your ex-wife. So there’s no problem.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7cn0dkc8bs8b8zym95e6djy)</span>

> Therefore the existence of Can-D, the experience of group translation, did not fully explain it.

Otherwise, as you can see–” She put her hand on his shoulder; the physical touch was there already. “It would be impossible. We’d simply wind up killing one another in our pain.”
> “Yes,” he said. “I see.” But he had not learned that by coming to Mars; he had, like every other Terran, known that early in life, heard of colony life, the struggle against the lure of internecine termination to it all in one swift surrender. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7csph5yahpmqtmbvvhpqxzq)</span>

> No one could fail to identify him; since his crash on Pluto the homeopapes had printed one pic after another. Of course the pics were ten years out of date, but this was still the man. Gray and bony, well over six feet tall, with swinging arms and a peculiarly rapid gait. And his face. It had a ravaged quality, eaten away; as if, Barney conjectured, the fat-layer had been consumed, as if Eldritch at some time or other had fed off himself, devoured perhaps with gusto the superfluous portions of his own body. He had enormous steel teeth, these having been installed prior to his trip to Prox by Czech dental surgeons; they were welded to his jaws, were permanent: he would die with them. And–his right arm was artificial. Twenty years ago in a hunting accident on Callisto he had lost the original; this one of course was superior in that it provided a specialized variety of interchangeable hands. At the moment Eldritch made use of the five-finger humanoid manual extremity; except for its metallic shine it might have been organic.
> And he was blind. At least from the standpoint of the natural-born body. But replacements had been made – at the prices which Eldritch could and would pay; that had been done just prior to his Prox voyage by Brazilian oculists. They had done a superb job.
