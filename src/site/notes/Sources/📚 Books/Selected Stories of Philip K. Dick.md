# Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick

## Thoughts

## Highlights
### Id739803437

> Dick was obsessed with stigma, with mutation and exile, and with the recurrent image of a spark of life or love arising from unlikely or ruined places: robot pets, discarded appliances, autistic children.

### Id739803438

> Kabir, the sixteenth-century Sufi poet, wrote, “If you have not lived through something, it is not true.” So live through it; I mean, go all the way to the end. Only then can it be understood, not along the way.

### Id739803439

> Dick famously posed two questions—“What is human?” and “What is real?”—and then sought to answer them in any framework he thought might suffice. By the time of his death he’d tried and discarded many dozen such frameworks. The questions remained. It is the absurd beauty of their asking that lasts.

### Id739803440

> What helps for me—if help comes at all—is to find the mustard seed of the funny at the core of the horrible and futile. I’ve been researching ponderous and solemn theological matters for five years now, for my novel-in-progress, and much of the Wisdom of the World has passed from the printed page and into my brain, there to be processed and secreted out in the form of more words: words in, words out, and a brain in the middle wearily trying to determine the meaning of it all.

### Id739803441

> Push philosophy and theology to their ultimate and what do you wind up with? Nothing. Nothing exists. As I said earlier, there is only one way out: seeing it all as ultimately funny.

- [N] I feel like I've had this conversation so many times with Devon. At the end of the day nothing really matters, nothing exists, and it's funny, all you can do is find the humor and get some giggles out of this life.

### Id739803696

> PAYCHECK

### Id739803442

> The SP would work him over. It would be a long time before they’d believe him, and by that time— He glanced quickly around. Was there any escape? In a second they would be back. He touched the door. Locked, the triple-ring magnetic locks. He had worked on magnetic locks many times. He had even designed part of a trigger core. There was no way to open the doors without the right code key. No way, unless by some chance he could short out the lock. But with what?

- [N] #on/writing #on/storytelling - I like this strategy of toying with the idea of revealing the result but hopping back to the present and letting it play out. The narrator knows what happens, but just won't tell us yet.

### Id739803443

> Sweat rolled down Jennings’ forehead. He moved the wire a fraction of an inch, twisting it. He held his breath. The relay should be— A flash. Half blinded, he threw his weight against the door. The door fell open, the lock fused and smoking. Jennings tumbled into the street and leaped to his feet. Cruisers were all around him, honking and sweeping past. He ducked behind a lumbering truck, entering the middle lane of traffic. On the sidewalk he caught a momentary glimpse of the SP men starting after him. A bus came along, swaying from side to side, loaded with shoppers and workers. Jennings caught hold of the back rail, pulling himself up onto the platform. Astonished faces loomed up, pale moons thrust suddenly at him. The robot conductor was coming toward him, whirring angrily. “Sir—” the conductor began. The bus was slowing down. “Sir, it is not allowed—” “It’s all right,” Jennings said. He was filled, all at once, with a strange elation. A moment ago he had been trapped, with no way to escape. Two years of his life had been lost for nothing. The Security Police had arrested him, demanding information he couldn’t give. A hopeless situation! But now things were beginning to click in his mind. He reached into his pocket and brought out the bus token. He put it calmly into the conductor’s coin slot.

- [N] Just an awesome and concise entire scene of suspense and action. Also foreshadowing that the reason he switched his contract from money to the items was for this exact scenario, to save him from the police. Has this happened before? How many times has he been through this?

### Id739803444

> If he could get back to the Company, get inside its doors, he would be safe. Jennings smiled grimly. The modern church, sanctuary. It was the Government against the corporation, rather than the State against the Church. The new Notre Dame of the world. Where the law could not follow.

### Id739803445

> Jennings crossed the field to the waiting room, studying the people around him. Ordinary people, workmen, businessmen, housewives. Stuartsville was a small Middle Western town. Truck drivers. High school kids.

- [N] #on/writing #on/storytelling Love these concise descriptions, fragments of sentences, just words. Paints a vivid picture and I can see myself writing in this way (as opposed to say, Lovecrafts verbose use of "ornate", decorative language

### Id739803446

> The street was dark. At the corner a lamppost cast a fitful beam. A few cruisers moved by. From the apartment building entrance a slim shape came, a young woman in a coat, a purse in her hand. Jennings watched as she passed under the streetlamp. Kelly McVane was going someplace, probably to a party. Smartly dressed, high heels tap-tapping on the pavement, a little coat and hat.

- [N] #on/writing #on/storytelling great imagery

### Id739803447

> Not time travel. Berkowsky demonstrated that time travel is impossible. This is a time scoop, a mirror to see and a scoop to pick up things. These trinkets. At least one of them is from the future. Scooped up. Brought back.”

### Id739803448

> There, beyond the steel door, was the time scoop. He recognized it at once. The mirror. The long metal rods, ending in claws. Like Berkowsky’s theoretical model—only this was real.

- [N] #on/writing #on/storytelling I like the idea of coming up it's some sort of technology, and a backstory about it. In this case a scientist has developed a "time scoop" that Dick physically describes

### Id739803449

> “When he saw government and big business closing in on everyone, he went underground. Rethrick Construction disappeared from the map. It took government quite a while to organize Maine, longer than most places. When the rest of the world had been divided up between international cartels and world-states, there was New England, still alive. Still free. And my grandfather and Rethrick Construction.

- [N] I like the alternate worlds Dick builds

### Id739803450

> “Someday, Jennings, we’re going to break out. You see, conditions like this can’t go on. People can’t live this way, tossed back and forth by political and economic powers. Masses of people shoved this way and that according to the needs of this government or that cartel. There’s going to be resistance, someday. A strong, desperate resistance. Not by big people, powerful people, but by little people. Bus drivers. Grocers. Vidscreen operators. Waiters. And that’s where the Company comes in. “We’re going to provide them with the help they’ll need, the tools, weapons, the knowledge. We’re going to ‘sell’ them our services. They’ll be able to hire us. And they’ll need someone they can hire. They’ll have a lot lined up against them. A lot of wealth and power.”

- [N] Lol, selling the workers the revolution. Capitalizing off of the need to revolt against corporations, 🤦‍♂️

> SECOND VARIETY

### Id741251091

### Id746383070

> As the Tassos reached for him, a last ironic thought drifted through Hendricks’s mind. He felt a little better, thinking about it. The bomb. Made by the Second Variety to destroy the other varieties. Made for that end alone. They were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other.

### Id746383071

> Imposter

### Id746383072

> “Like the Sword of Damocles. Always hanging over us. I’m getting tired. All I want to do is take a long rest. But I guess everybody feels that way.”

### Id746383073

> “It’ll be good when we get the Project into final stage. Maybe it’s just the propaganda from the news-machines, but in the last month I’ve gotten weary of all this. Everything seems so grim and serious, no color to life.”

### Id746383074

> Perhaps at some other time, when there was no war, men might not act this way, hurrying an individual to his death because they were afraid. Everyone was frightened, everyone was willing to sacrifice the individual because of the group fear.

### Id746383075

> He ran, throwing himself into the bushes. A security officer shoved Mary out of the way, firing past her. The bushes burst apart. Olham wriggled around the side of the house. He leaped up and ran, racing frantically into the darkness. A searchlight snapped on, a beam of light circling past him. He crossed the road and squeezed over a fence. He jumped down and made his way across a backyard. Behind him men were coming, security officers, shouting to each other as they came. Olham gasped for breath, his chest rising and falling.

- [N] Love the simple prose he uses

### Id746383076

> He did not complete the sentence, only the first phrase. The blast was visible all the way to Alpha Centauri.

### Id748415740

> The King of the Elves

### Id748415741

> “He trusted you,” the Elf said. “You brought him inside your house, out of the rain. He knew that you expected nothing for it, that there was nothing you wanted. He had known few who gave and asked nothing back.”

### Id748415742

> Something was completely wrong. And he had never noticed it, not in all the years they had been friends. All around Phineas Judd was an odor, a faint, pungent stench of rot, of decaying flesh, damp and moldy.

### Id748415743

> The Trolls swarmed forward, a growing wave of gnashing teeth and nails, pushing furiously toward the Elf columns. The Elves broke formation and joined battle, shouting with wild joy in their shrill, piping voices. The tide of Trolls rushed against them, Troll against Elf, shovel nails against golden sword, biting jaw against dagger. “Kill the Elves!” “Death to the Trolls!”

### Id748415744

> Adjustment Team

### Id748415745

> a jagged cavity yawned—an

- [N] Second time today (Lovecraft in Juan Romeros) that someone used "yawn" to describe a huge opening

### Id748415746

> The seller’s arm came loose. It fell to the lobby floor, disintegrating into fragments. Bits of gray fiber. Like dust. Ed’s senses reeled.

### Id748415747

> The phone booth passed through the ceiling of the building and out into the bright sunlight. It gained speed. The ground fell away below. Buildings and streets were getting smaller each moment. Tiny specks hurried along, far below, cars and people, dwindling rapidly.  
> He picked up his rifle and stepped carefully up to the mouth of the bunker, making his way between blocks of concrete and steel prongs, twisted and bent. The air was cold at the top. He crossed over the ground toward the remains of the soldier, striding across the soft ash. A wind blew around him, swirling gray particles up in his face. He squinted and pushed on.
