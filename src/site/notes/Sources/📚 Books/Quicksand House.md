# Quicksand House

## Thoughts

## Highlights
> “Now babies are born ugly,” says Nanny Warburough, picking the baby up into the air. “And while the cuteness factor used to attract adult humans to infants, these days the ugliness factor does the opposite. It causes adults to

> reject them. Parents don’t want to have anything to do with their young until they grow up.”

> “It’s not just your parents,” the nanny says. “It’s all human parents. That’s why children are raised in nurseries. A long time ago, parents tried to raise their children themselves, but because the parents were horrified by their children they could not bring themselves to love them. In fact, they loathed their children. With everyone growing up unloved by their parents, it had an incredibly negative effect on human civilization. People grew cold and heartless. Now that children are raised in nurseries, detached from their parents and human civilization, they are able to be raised in a caring environment.”

> At dinner, the children are served a mixture of bubblegum ice cream fish filets with sunny side up eggs for skin and cucumber toast.

> The nanny hits herself on the thigh in three different places. Then she tears her own leg off. “It’s my job to protect the children,” she says. “And I know how to defend them.” Then she raises her severed leg over her head. Tick never knew the nanny had a fake leg. It is made of metal. The nanny stretches the leg out and twists the foot sideways like an axe-blade. “What the heck…” Tick says. The severed leg has been transformed into a weapon. Polly screams as she rushes the nanny, aiming her antlers at the woman’s face, as if trying to gouge out her eyes. Nanny Warburough swings the leg, clubbing Polly in the side of the head. Blood sprays from the girl’s scalp, her antlers twist to the side, and then she falls to the ground. “Get out of the nursery!” Nanny screams, hopping on one foot toward the fallen girl.

> Polly curls into a ball, shrieking like a demon, as the old woman beats her with the foot-club, hitting her in the stomach and ribs.

> “Intruder!” Nanny cries. “I’ll kill you!” She raises the leg-club above her head, aiming to crush the young woman’s skull. Polly holds out her hands. “Nanny…” Tears are in her eyes, melting her freshly applied makeup down her cheeks. The makeup she put on to look pretty for the parents who never actually came. “Don’t…” Tick jumps up behind her and grabs the leg-weapon by the ankle. “I just want to meet my mommy and daddy…” Polly cries, holding the broken rib sticking out of the side of her dress. “Just let me see my mommy and daddy.” Tick loses his grip on the fake leg. He can’t hold it back any longer. His fingers slide off and Nanny lowers the club into Polly’s face. Like a dull axe, the metal toes of the

> club split open her head. She screams in one quick burst, and then her body goes limp. When he sees his sister’s face break open, the blood splashing into the air, Tick’s voice becomes a high-pitched screech. “Stop it!” He jumps at Nanny’s remaining leg, knocking her off balance. As she collapses, the old woman says, “Ricky, what is—” but her voice is cut short as she hits the side of the large iron toy box. Her neck twists back. Her face breaks off. Then everything goes silent. The only sound left in the room is the violent thumping of Tick’s heart and the hideous baby squeaking in the playpen, begging to be fed.

> He bangs his flashlight three more times. The light comes back on for just a second and then turns off again. In that brief flash, he sees the woman’s face. Her skin is black and charred, as if made of soot. Her eyes are black balls of coal. Her lips like wrinkled licorice whips. She’s not like Polly. She’s not even human. The second she sees Tick in her cold dead eyes, the creature shrieks. She raises her claws and thrashes toward him. Tick throws his flashlight at her, but it misses and lands on the other end of the crawlspace. “Get away!” Tick screams. Just before she can grab him, Tick dives through the vent into Polly’s room. He lands on the collapsed bookcase on the floor. He looks back and sees claws reaching out for him through the vent, but she can’t get to him. The size of her antlers prevents her from getting through. He flips the light switch on and the woman disappears. There’s nothing there but an empty hole where the vent used to be. “Where’d she go?” Tick says. He takes a few steps closer, peers into the crawlspace. There’s nothing there. The woman just vanished.

> Tick tells Polly about what happened at school that day. He explains how the sky had no color, the class was upside down, and how Justin was trapped in the wall, speaking in a loop.
