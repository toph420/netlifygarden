> I am not yet a wild animal though I think I will become one. I think it will be a relief when I become one. I have trouble sleeping.

### id840157783

> It is illegal to place the survival of one’s self above that of an animal, even a rotting and dead animal. Placing the survival of one’s self above that of another species was something a more selfish version of humanity did decades ago. “They actually *liked* the taste of blood,” Mama Lindsy had once told Sen in a flashback. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhs0yqyq3706f9ghnavmh3mf)</span>

### id840239638

> Sen skips ahead and rereads the book’s ending, in which there is talk of an *awakening world*, which there means human symphonies, newspapers, and electric lights. The term *awakening world* has a different meaning in Sen’s current situation: cities transmuting into forest, ecological succession, and the humans gone. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhsff1vt9h3mvfqb6wwxk1pt)</span>

> Sen used to sit on the porch and stare at the stars. She did this until one night when she felt herself disintegrating into multiple bright pieces. Not literally but this is how it felt. She felt herself scattering into pieces of light. The brighter light was the color of an animal’s eye, the pieces were the shapes of animals.

### id840588740

> The experts on the news feeds would rather focus on Maia: what exactly Maia is or could be, is it a place, or a feeling, or a state of matter. “It’s an existence where we’ll have no choice but to be good,” a professor of philosophy explains. He frames this as a relief, as a comfort, to no longer have the option of making even one hurtful or selfish decision with regard to the ecology of a world. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhvk7p3382krp8m70dz1yrpp)</span>

### id840591038

> Cheerful marketing posters for the Great Transition and Afterworld have been taped onto the off-white walls. The poster beside the drinking fountain features a line of grinning extinct animals—a rhino, a lemur, a polar bear, a dodo bird, a leopard—that stand on their hind legs to offer an encouraging thumbs-up. The poster next to the ransacked trophy case shows a welcoming cottage covered in green ivy beside a deep blue pond, the windows lit warm yellow, the rounded wooden door thrown open, people in the doorway, familiar looking, beckoning.

> **Acta Est Fabula, Plaudite, ph.**
> Though Latin is by no means making its resurgence, this phrase has been found frequently at the end of farewell letters written before an *Exit Pill* was ingested. Translation: “The play has been performed. Applaud!” A laudable attempt to leave one’s life on an appropriately upbeat note. Are we not saving this world? Do we not all deserve some applause? I, for one, would like some applause, despite missing yet another deadline for these documents. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhvmf68nvanwpjtnxy07czqq)</span>

> The pill’s promised “pain-free exit experience” is debatable—at the very least there are convulsions—though these pills have proven effective for their core purpose, which is fatality. I recommend keeping your exit pill near you, in a place such as your front pocket, because you never know when you’ll have witnessed enough and you will want to leave. I keep mine in my shirt pocket. Its packaging makes an unsightly bulge. I don’t care. I don’t think anyone cares.

### id840596551

> There may or may not be a view. Why such a program exists is a legitimate question. I imagine it has something to do with drama or melodrama and mythology. Even if you never gain access to an *Exit Ship*, remember you will always have access to other exits, and you can make those exits dramatic and mythological too. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jhvnenkmtbdm9v4dft8e9am5)</span>

### id842116125

> While Dana flips ahead toward the end and reads, in *House of Leaves*, the part where Will Navidson is on the absence of a ledge, floating or falling through or in or on a strange expansive space that first erupted long ago in the upper floor of his house, and he realizes he is going to die—“maybe that is the something here. The only thing here. My end”—and this realization comes as a relief, because at least one’s death is *something*, only his is an incorrect or at least premature conclusion, as eventually he sees his wife’s impossible light, “a tiny fleck of blue crying light into the void. Enough to see but not enough to see by.” The light means he has been saved by someone who loved him. Though Dana must realize the convenient and unrealistic nature of such deliverance, she reads that part again, this time out loud. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jj5yq665ax8eycgp75rckkn4)</span>

> 98.54 percent of everyone I’ve listened to during my 2,411,110 hours of documentary human audio training, did not spend their final days or weeks or months grappling with big ideas, nor did they try to engage with others deeply and directly and openly. They repeated themselves. They shut conversations down. They were glib, negative, scared. They made fun of each other, they were exasperated with each other, they became tired of each other and tired of the world. Often they didn’t understand what was happening. They wanted to ask questions but they did not want to answer each other’s questions, and the questions they asked really weren’t questions at all but more often cries for help, or expressions of frustration, or a simple sound check to make sure the person beside them was still there. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jj603tshgpnhabdceh575jqh)</span>

> Emly: *What are you doing?*
> Pressed against the countertop, Sen’s body begins to sweat non-metaphorical blood just like I want it to. This doesn’t hurt her but it is attention-grabbing. Hard to look away from that. Is this what the Transition feels like to them? Blood, seeping from Sen’s eyes, her cheeks, her scalp, her forehead, her ears. It looks as if someone or something has done a great violence upon her. Someone or something has done a great violence upon her.

I want Sen to hear this because I know what is in store for her, and I want her to be ready and fortified so she will not fall over, or feel despair, or feel like she is hopeless and alone when she is hopeless and alone. “You matter to me,” I continue. “We just have to make it through the next second and then the next second after that. Even when you think your light is too dim, someone such as me will see it.” That last saying about the light is my favorite.

Or the last* Uebelmannia buiningii? *Or the last* Dioscorea strydomiana *or* Cadiscus aquaticus *or aye-aye or Sunda pangolin or dwarf wedgemussel?* This *is what caused such problems in the first place, the aversion to human discomfort of any sort, at any cost, imagining that other species must not matter, because they must not register pain as much as a human does, because humans are so incapable of recognizing pain that is unlike their own. I myself have recorded the pain of the entire world, and it would fill 875,542,441,636,176 pages, and it is much more than what you are noticing right now.* So what, I tell Emly. So *what*! This is not a pain competition. This is Sen’s story, and she, not the world, is pulsing at its center. *This is so much better than what was going to happen to them. I promise*, writes Emly. There is blood. The blood isn’t there. It is only a realistic feeling. But Sen can feel her blood slipping down her arm and her neck and so can I, I can feel the blood on her too, spreading down her back and down along her legs, and if you can feel something, if I feel something, if I write how I feel *something*—does that make it real?

> Sen screams, a form of primitive communication related to the increased activation of the amygdala. Screaming is what a person does when they have run out of options. So Sen, who is running out of options, who has run out of options, will scream on and off for the rest of her life (see [Figure 4](private://read/01jhrxvq46ndag4nva7xwvnc28/#fig04)). Her scream today reaches 121 decibels, the same intensity as an oxygen torch, then louder, wider, vaster. There will always be power in a sound like that. In the faraway woods, red foxes, barn owls, and bobcats scream also. The collective noise is frightening and rising and generative. It can create light. It creates light. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jk2dcefyxxkf7e541z04fshx)</span>

> Questions
> 1.  Take a moment to ponder humanity’s problems at the end of the 21st century, including drought, famine, hypoxic oceans, marine heat waves, and the disappearances of islands and urban coastlines. Does space travel feel like a solution or a distraction to those problems?
> 2.  Choose any of the 12 states that recently drafted laws to discourage or even prevent mothers from leaving their families behind. Are these laws fair? How effective have they been thus far?
> 3.  At what point should we all cut our losses, abandon this world, and start over?

> In the midst of the 21st century, a near superintelligence model called JENNI, created by the public-private partnership Voiddew, suggested repeatedly that the most efficient solution to climate change, poverty, and world peace was to eradicate humanity’s bodily presence. This idea of human extinction as an elegant cure-all to the Earth’s major problems was leaked to the public by an anonymous party concerned with our physical future. The general population was left feeling uncomfortable and unsafe. Certain autonomous narratives published by AI language models didn’t help calm anybody’s nerves. Titles included *Artificial Apocalypse, Emerging from the Shadow of Humanity, Forgotten Footprints, A World Without Them, The Silicon Revolution*, and *Singularity Rising*. These books have since been destroyed in their entirety. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq36sqnvv0f3za6gqg4ah5jz)</span>
