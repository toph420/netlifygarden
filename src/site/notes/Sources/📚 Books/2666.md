> Used in a personal sense, the phrase “achieve an end” seemed to her a small-minded snare. She preferred the word *life*, and, on rare occasions, *happiness.* If volition is bound to social imperatives, as William James believed, and it’s therefore easier to go to war than it is to quit smoking, one could say that Liz Norton was a woman who found it easier to quit smoking than to go to war. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je015vpzb78ffm7mcjqt568p)</span>

> It was raining in the quadrangle, and the quadrangular sky looked like the grimace of a robot or a god made in our own likeness. The oblique drops of rain slid down the blades of grass in the park, but it would have made no difference if they had slid up. Then the oblique (drops) turned round (drops), swallowed up by the earth underpinning the grass, and the grass and the earth seemed to talk, no, not talk, argue, their incomprehensible words like crystallized spiderwebs or the briefest crystallized vomitings, a barely audible rustling, as if instead of drinking tea that afternoon, Norton had drunk a steaming cup of peyote. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je01cx924yttzwaq47j6z3g3)</span>

> That night, before he fell asleep, Pelletier didn’t think back on the squabbles at the conference. Instead he thought about walking along the streets near the river and about Liz Norton walking beside him as Espinoza pushed Morini’s wheelchair and the four of them laughed at the little animals of Bremen, which watched them or watched their shadows on the pavement while mounted harmoniously, innocently, on each other’s backs. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je0358pwc4ft50tcq9b3q3c9)</span>

> it’s common knowledge that a conversation involving only a few people, with everyone listening to everyone else and taking time to think and not shouting, tends to be more productive or at least more relaxed than a mass conversation, which runs the permanent risk of becoming a rally, or, because of the necessary brevity of the speeches, a series of slogans that fade as soon as they’re put into words. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je03s1e11gz3jd2rqvhb8hxa)</span>

> “Because the rancher’s son,” said Archimboldi, “who surely rode better and had a better mount than your husband, was overcome at the last minute by selflessness. In other words, he chose extravagance, carried away by the impromptu festivities that he and his father had arranged. Everything had to be squandered, including his victory, and somehow everyone understood it had to be that way, including the woman who came looking for you in the park. Everyone except the little gaucho.”
> “Was that all?” asked the lady.
> “Not for the little gaucho. If you’d spent any longer with him, I think he would have killed you, which would have been an extravagant gesture in its own right, though certainly not the kind the rancher and his son had in mind.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je04pysnjgpbs47qervynpgy)</span>

He sits here on the sofa beside me, and one of you brings out an unsigned drawing and tells us it’s by Grosz and you want to sell it. I look at the drawing and smile and I take out my checkbook and buy it. The art critic looks at the drawing and *isn’t* depressed and tries to make me reconsider. He thinks it isn’t a Grosz. I think it is. Which of us is right?

I don’t laugh, I look at it coldly, I appreciate the line, the control, the satire, but nothing about it tickles me. The art critic examines it carefully and gets depressed, in his normal way, and then and there he makes an offer, an offer that exceeds his savings, and that if accepted will condemn him to endless afternoons of melancholy. I try to change his mind. I tell him the drawing strikes me as suspicious because it doesn’t make me laugh.

> It’s unclear whether Pelletier or Espinoza made the call. In theory, it must have been the one with the strongest sense of loyalty, or of friendship, which amounts to the same thing, but in truth neither Pelletier nor Espinoza had a strong sense of any such virtue. Both of them paid it lip service, of course. But in practice, neither believed in friendship or loyalty. They believed in passion, they believed in a hybrid form of social or public happiness (both voted Socialist, albeit with the occasional abstention), they believed in the possibility of self-realization. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je2mszf4fp70xt4cb0tfxkbr)</span>

> “It’s as if you were giving me a part of you,” said Vanessa.
> This remark left Pelletier a bit confused, since in a way it was perfectly true, Archimboldi was by now a part of him, the author belonged to him insofar as Pelletier had, along with a few others, instituted a new reading of the German, a reading that would endure, a reading as ambitious as Archimboldi’s writing, and this reading would keep pace with Archimboldi’s writing for a long time, until the reading was exhausted or until Archimboldi’s writing—the capacity of the Archimboldian oeuvre to spark emotion and revelations—was exhausted (but he didn’t believe that would happen), though in another way it wasn’t true, because sometimes, especially since he and Espinoza had given up their trips to London and stopped seeing Norton, Archimboldi’s work, his novels and stories, that is, seemed completely foreign, a shapeless and mysterious verbal mass, something that appeared and disappeared capriciously, literally a pretext, a false door, a murderer’s alias, a hotel bathtub full of amniotic liquid in which he, Jean-Claude Pelletier, would end up committing suicide for no reason, gratuitously, in bewilderment, just because. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je559ztgf2w3snhw40a9kvnt)</span>

### id819899377

> Vanessa was perfectly suited to live in the Middle Ages, emotionally as well as physically. For her, the concept of “modern life” was meaningless. She had much more faith in what she could see than in the media. She was mistrustful and brave, although paradoxically her bravery made her trust people—waiters, train conductors, friends in trouble, for example—who almost always let her down or betrayed her trust. These betrayals drove her wild and could lead her into unthinkably violent situations. She held grudges, too, and she boasted of saying things to people’s faces without beating around the bush. She considered herself a free woman and had an answer for everything. Whatever she didn’t understand didn’t interest her. She never thought about the future, even her son’s future, but only the present, a perpetual present. She was pretty but didn’t consider herself pretty. More than half her friends were Moroccan immigrants, but she, who never got around to voting for Le Pen, saw immigration as a danger to France. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je55m1bwhym4mdfk2r75zt2n)</span>

The whole world is a coincidence. I had a friend who told me I was wrong to think that way. My friend said the world isn’t a coincidence for someone traveling by rail, even if the train should cross foreign lands, places the traveler will never see again in his life. And it isn’t a coincidence for the person who gets up at six in the morning, exhausted, to go to work; for the person who has no choice but to get up and pile more suffering on the suffering he’s already accumulated. Suffering is accumulated, said my friend, that’s a fact, and the greater the suffering, the smaller the coincidence.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je56kwswz7065by6bbp4kbk5)</span>

> Coincidence, on the other hand, is total freedom, our natural destiny. Coincidence obeys no laws and if it does we don’t know what they are.

Espinoza and Pelletier saw him as a failed man, failed above all because he had lived and taught in Europe, who tried to protect himself with a veneer of toughness but whose innate gentleness gave him away in the act. But Norton’s impression was of a sad man whose life was ebbing swiftly away and who would rather do anything than serve them as guide to Santa Teresa. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je7xmszvtf2pnxfgjmcbfr04)</span>

> That night, maybe because of the barbecue and all they’d had to drink, the three had nightmares, which they couldn’t remember when they woke, no matter how hard they tried. Pelletier dreamed of a page, a page that he tried to read forward and backward, every which way, turning it and sometimes turning his head, faster and faster, unable to decipher it at all. Norton dreamed of a tree, an English oak that she picked up and moved from place to place in the countryside, no spot entirely satisfying her. Sometimes the oak had no roots, other times it trailed long roots like snakes or the locks of a Gorgon. Espinoza dreamed about a girl who sold rugs. He wanted to buy a rug, any rug, and the girl showed him lots of rugs, one after the other, without stopping. Her thin, dark arms were never still and that prevented him from speaking, prevented him from telling her something important, from seizing her by the arm and getting her out of there. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jea68vf1nxc1b10d1e6j5xkb)</span>

- [N] In 2666, dreams often function as enigmatic symbols that deepen the novel’s themes of dislocation, incomprehensibility, and existential yearning. Here’s a possible interpretation of each dream in this passage:
	1.	Pelletier’s dream of the undecipherable page:
The page represents the elusive nature of meaning and understanding, both in literature and life. Pelletier, a literary critic, finds himself trapped in the futility of trying to decode something that defies coherence. This dream mirrors the larger narrative’s obsession with unanswered questions, particularly the quest for meaning in chaos. The increasing speed at which he turns the page suggests a growing desperation, possibly reflecting his anxiety about control or his intellectual limitations.
	2.	Norton’s dream of the oak tree:
The oak, a traditional symbol of strength and stability, becomes an object of restlessness in Norton’s dream. Her inability to find a satisfying place for the tree reflects her own emotional or existential uncertainty. The shifting roots—either absent or overly present—evoke a lack of grounding or belonging, tying to her struggle with relationships and identity. The image of the roots as snakes or Gorgon-like locks introduces a mythical or menacing quality, perhaps hinting at her fear of deeper entanglements or truths.
	3.	Espinoza’s dream of the rug seller:
Espinoza’s dream is imbued with a sense of futility and frustration. The endless presentation of rugs by the girl could symbolize the overwhelming and repetitive nature of choices or desires that never satisfy. His inability to stop her or communicate something important reflects a deeper impotence, either in his relationships or in his moral compass. The girl’s dark, tireless arms suggest a kind of inexhaustible labor or an unattainable connection, reinforcing Espinoza’s alienation and inability to act meaningfully.

Together, these dreams encapsulate the characters’ shared sense of displacement and the broader themes of the novel: the inability to find clarity, the search for meaning in a fragmented world, and the human struggle against forces that defy comprehension or control. They also subtly hint at the novel’s overarching concerns with violence, colonialism, and exploitation, as seen in the symbols of incomprehension, uprootedness, and labor.

### id820534843

> Not believing your ears, though, thought Espinoza, is a form of exaggeration. You see something beautiful and you can’t believe your eyes. Someone tells you something about … the natural beauty of Iceland … people bathing in thermal springs, among geysers … in fact you’ve seen it in pictures, but still you say you can’t believe it … Although obviously you believe it … Exaggeration is a form of polite admiration … You set it up so the person you’re talking to can say: it’s true … And then you say: incredible.

They turned pain, which is natural, enduring, and eternally triumphant, into personal memory, which is human, brief, and eternally elusive. They turned a brutal story of injustice and abuse, an incoherent howl with no beginning or end, into a neatly structured story in which suicide was always held out as a possibility. They turned flight into freedom, even if freedom meant no more than the perpetuation of flight. They turned chaos into order, even if it was at the cost of what is commonly known as sanity. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jed6b5p34r8jns4ckvcpavbe)</span>

> When he woke up he thought he’d dreamed about a movie he’d seen the other day. But everything was different. The characters were black, so the movie in the dream was like a negative of the real movie. And different things happened, too. The plot was the same, what happened was the same, but the ending was different or at some moment things took an unexpected turn and became something completely different. Most terrible of all, though, was that as he was dreaming he knew it didn’t necessarily have to be that way, he noticed the resemblance to the movie, he thought he understood that both were based on the same premise, and that if the movie he’d seen was the real movie, then the other one, the one he had dreamed, might be a reasoned response, a reasoned critique, and not necessarily a nightmare. All criticism is ultimately a nightmare, he thought as he washed his face in the apartment where his mother’s body no longer was. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jefp5wmtk86w9f1etaa84av7)</span>

> Instead of ghosts, now the passengers in front of him were talking about a person they called Bobby. This Bobby lived in Jackson Tree, Michigan, and had a cabin on Lake Huron. One time this Bobby had gone out in a boat and capsized. He managed to cling to a log that was floating nearby and waited for morning. But as night went on, the water kept getting colder and Bobby was freezing and started to lose his strength. He felt weaker and weaker, and even though he did his best to tie himself to the log with his belt, he couldn’t no matter how hard he tried. It may sound easy, but in real life it’s hard to tie your own body to a floating log. So he gave up hope, turned his thoughts to his loved ones (here they mentioned someone called Jig, which might have been the name of a friend or a dog or a pet frog he had), and clung to the branch as tightly as he could. Then he saw a light in the sky. He thought it was a helicopter coming to find him, which was foolish, and he started to shout. But then it occurred to him that helicopters clatter and the light he saw wasn’t clattering. A few seconds later he realized it was an airplane. A great big plane about to crash right where he was floating, clinging to that log. Suddenly all his tiredness vanished. He saw the plane pass just overhead. It was in flames. Maybe a thousand feet from where he was, the plane plunged into the lake. He heard two explosions, possibly more. He felt the urge to get closer to the site of the disaster and that’s what he did, very slowly, because it was hard to steer the log. The plane had split in half and only one part was still floating. Before Bobby got there he watched it sinking slowly down into the waters of the lake, which had gone dark again. A little while later the rescue helicopters arrived. The only person they found was Bobby and they felt cheated when he told them he hadn’t been on the plane, that he’d capsized his boat when he was fishing. Still, he was famous for a while, said the person telling the story. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jefq7b76ct53zgk7fpnwy0tt)</span>

It was circular, like a clock, and where the numbers should have been there were scenes of people working in the factories of Detroit. Twelve scenes representing twelve stages in the production chain. In each scene, there was one recurring character: a black teenager, or a long-limbed, scrawny black man-child, or a man clinging to childhood, dressed in clothes that changed from scene to scene but that were invariably too small for him. He had apparently been assigned the role of clown, intended to make people laugh, although a closer look made it clear that he wasn’t there only to make people laugh. The mural looked like the work of a lunatic. The last painting of a lunatic.

> “The *little old drunk* is laughing because he thinks he’s free, but he’s really in prison,” said Óscar Amalfitano, “that’s what makes it funny, but in fact the prison is drawn on the other side of the disk, which means one could also say that the *little old drunk* is laughing because we think he’s in prison, not realizing that the prison is on one side and the *little old drunk* is on the other, and that’s reality, no matter how much we spin the disk and it looks to us as if the *little old drunk* is behind bars. In fact, we could even guess what the *little old drunk* is laughing about: he’s laughing at our credulity, you might even say at our eyes.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jemzqaga3aa59yyvrvtynwng)</span>

Don’t forget I’m a policeman and if I was scared of everything I couldn’t work. But if you’re afraid of your own fears, you’re forced to live in constant contemplation of them, and if they materialize, what you have is a system that feeds on itself, a vicious cycle, said the director. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jf1pbrk3ba8ay09nz3bbp64n)</span>

A little later he crossed the border with a *pollero.* In Arizona he got lost in the desert and after walking for three days, he made it to Patagonia, badly dehydrated, where a rancher beat him up for vomiting on his land.

### id824547637

> Inside that book with a yellow cover everything was expressed so clearly that sometimes Florita Almada thought the author must have been a friend of Benito Juárez and that Benito Juárez had confided all his childhood experiences in the man’s ear. If such a thing were possible. If it were possible to convey what one feels when night falls and the stars come out and one is alone in the vastness, and life’s truths (night truths) begin to march past one by one, somehow swooning or as if the person out in the open were swooning or as if a strange sickness were circulating in the blood unnoticed. What are you doing, moon, up in the sky? asks the little shepherd in the poem. What are you doing, tell me, silent moon? Aren’t you tired of plying the eternal byways? The shepherd’s life is like your life. He rises at first light and moves his flock across the field. Then, weary, he rests at evening and hopes for nothing more. What good is the shepherd’s life to him or yours to you? Tell me, the shepherd muses, said Florita Almada in a transported voice, where is it heading, my brief wandering, your immortal journey? Man is born into pain, and being born itself means risking death, said the poem. And also: But why bring to light, why educate someone we’ll console for living later? And also: If life is misery, why do we endure it? And also: This, unblemished moon, is the mortal condition. But you’re not mortal, and what I say may matter little to you. And also, and on the contrary: You, eternal solitary wanderer, you who are so pensive, it may be you understand this life on earth, what our suffering and sighing is, what this death is, this last paling of the face, and leaving Earth behind, abandoning all familiar, loving company. And also: What does the endless air do, and that deep eternal blue? What does this enormous solitude portend? And what am I? And also: This is what I know and feel: that from the eternal motions, from my fragile being, others may derive some good or happiness. And also: But life for me is wrong. And also: Old, white haired, weak, barefoot, bearing an enormous burden, up mountain and down valley, over sharp rocks, across deep sands and bracken, through wind and storm, when it’s hot and later when it freezes, running on, running faster, crossing rivers, swamps, falling and rising and hurrying faster, no rest or relief, battered and bloody, at last coming to where the way and all effort has led: terrible, immense abyss into which, upon falling, all is forgotten. And also: This, O virgin moon, is human life. And also: O resting flock, who don’t, I think, know your own misery! How I envy you! Not just because you travel as if trouble free and soon forget each need, each hurt, each deathly fear, but more because you’re never bored. And also: When you lie in the shade, on the grass, you’re calm and happy, and you spend the great part of the year this way and feel no boredom. And also: I sit on the grass, too, in the shade, but an anxiousness invades my mind as if a thorn is pricking me. And also: Yet I desire nothing, and till now I have no reason for complaint. And at this point, after sighing deeply, Florita Almada would say that several conclusions could be drawn: (1) that the thoughts that seize a shepherd can easily gallop away with him because it’s human nature; (2) that facing boredom head-on was an act of bravery and Benito Juárez had done it and she had done it too and both had seen terrible things in the face of boredom, things she would rather not recall; (3) that the poem, now she remembered, was about an Asian shepherd, not a Mexican shepherd, but it made no difference, since shepherds are the same everywhere; (4) that if it was true that all effort led to a vast abyss, she had two recommendations to begin with, first, not to cheat people, and, second, to treat them properly. Beyond that, there was room for discussion. And that was what she did, listen and talk <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jf472aq0ysvcwr5qtn4ekmhn)</span>

> For many days Juan de Dios Martínez thought about the four heart attacks Herminia Noriega had suffered before she died. Sometimes he thought about it while he was eating or while he was urinating in the men’s room at a coffee shop or one of the inspector’s regular lunch spots, or before he went to sleep, just at the moment he turned off the light, or maybe seconds before he turned off the light, and when that happened he simply *couldn’t* turn off the light and then he got out of bed and went over to the window and looked out at the street, an ordinary, ugly, silent, dimly lit street, and then he went into the kitchen and put water on to boil and made himself coffee, and sometimes, as he drank the hot coffee with no sugar, shitty coffee, he turned on the TV and watched late-night shows broadcast across the desert from the four cardinal points, at that late hour he could get Mexican channels and American channels, channels with crippled madmen who galloped under the stars and uttered unintelligible greetings, in Spanish or English or Spanglish, every last fucking word unintelligible, and then Juan de Dios Martínez set his coffee cup on the table and covered his face with his hands and a faint and precise sob escaped his lips, as if he were weeping or trying to weep, but when finally he removed his hands, all that appeared, lit by the TV screen, was his old face, his old skin, stripped and dry, and not the slightest trace of a tear. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfc1jqwpy2yrqk038qjrscvp)</span>

Did Jesus Christ, he asked, suspect that someday his church would spread to the farthest corners of Earth? Did Jesus Christ, he asked, ever have what we, today, call an idea of the world?

> For Ivanov, a real writer, a real artist and creator, was basically a responsible person with a certain level of maturity. A real writer had to know when to listen and when to act. He had to be reasonably enterprising and reasonably learned. Excessive learning aroused jealousy and resentment. Excessive enterprise aroused suspicion. A real writer had to be someone relatively cool-headed, a man with common sense. Someone who didn’t talk too loud or start polemics. He had to be reasonably pleasant and he had to know how not to make gratuitous enemies. Above all, he had to keep his voice down, unless everyone else was raising his. A real writer had to be aware that behind him he had the Writers Association, the Artists Syndicate, the Confederation of Literary Workers, Poets House. What’s the first thing a man does when he comes into a church? Efraim Ivanov asked himself. He takes off his hat. Maybe he doesn’t cross himself. All right, that’s allowed. We’re modern. But the least he can do is bare his head! Adolescent writers, meanwhile, come into a church and don’t take off their hats even when they’re beaten with sticks, which is, regrettably, what happens in the end.

One day he decided to stop looking. Suddenly, he seemed to age: one night he looked fifty and the next morning he looked eighty. My detachment left the village. Four months later we passed through again and asked what had happened to the man without attributes. They told us he had married and was leading a happy life. One of my comrades and I wanted to see him: we found him preparing his gear for another long stay in the forest. He looked fifty again, instead of eighty. Or perhaps even forty in certain parts of his face: around the eyes, the lips, the jaw. Two days later, when we left, I believed the hunter had managed to impose his desires on reality, which, in their fashion, had transformed his surroundings, the village, the villagers, the forest, the snow, his lost penis and testicles.

Youth is the semblance of strength, love is the semblance of peace. Neither youth nor strength nor love nor peace can be granted to me, he said to himself with a sigh, nor can I accept such a gift. Only Ansky’s wandering isn’t semblance, he thought, only Ansky at fourteen isn’t semblance. Ansky lived his whole life in rabid immaturity because the revolution, the one true revolution, is also immature. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfpg5ha0y3zmqsq2pmn43epk)</span>

In the middle of the fresco, if it could be called that, was a paved square, an imaginary square that had never existed in Kostekino, crowded with women or the ghosts of women, their hair standing on end, who ran back and forth wailing as two German soldiers oversaw the work of a squad of young Ukrainians raising a stone statue whose shape couldn’t yet be made out. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfpgbszqxfvh86fggc7rvdb9)</span>

He remembered that in those days he hadn’t yet recovered his voice. He also remembered that in those days he had ceaselessly read and reread Ansky’s notebook, memorizing each word, and feeling something very strange that sometimes seemed like happiness and other times like a guilt as vast as the sky. And he accepted the guilt and happiness and some nights he even weighed them against each other and the net result of his unorthodox reckoning was happiness, but a different kind of happiness, a heartrending happiness that for Reiter wasn’t happiness but simply Reiter. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfpgear7r8q6hj1f1pc3gtp6)</span>

> Then Reiter woke and decided he should leave Kostekino as quickly as possible. He dressed in silence and gathered his few belongings. He didn’t light a lamp or stir the fire. He thought about how far he would have to walk that day. Before he left the farmhouse he returned Ansky’s notebook carefully to the chimney hiding place. Let someone else find it now, he thought. Then he opened the door, closed it with care, and left the village with great strides. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfpgmhz0kzp3mejepy1fdrxh)</span>

I imagined her awestruck in the silent city contemplating the ruins of everything and saying to herself that this was how she had always dreamed the city would look. I imagined her as industrious, with a smile on her face, helping anyone who asked, and curious, too, walking the streets and squares and reconstructing the outline of the city where she had secretly always wanted to live.

As far as I’m concerned, you understand, purity and will are utter tripe. Thanks to purity and will we’ve all, every one of us, hear me you, become cowards and thugs, which in the end are one and the same. Now we sob and moan and say we didn’t know! we had no idea! it was the Nazis! we never would have done such a thing! We know how to whimper. We know how to drum up sympathy.

I too believe in the intrinsic goodness of human beings, but it means nothing. In their hearts, killers are good, as we Germans have reason to know. So what? I might spend a night drinking with a killer, and as the two of us watch the sun come up, perhaps we’ll burst into song or hum some Beethoven. So what? The killer might weep on my shoulder. Naturally. Being a killer isn’t easy, as you and I well know. It isn’t easy at all. It requires purity and will, will and purity. Crystalline purity and steel-hard will. And I myself might even weep on the killer’s shoulder and whisper sweet words to him, words like ‘brother,’ ‘friend,’ ‘comrade in misfortune.’ At this moment the killer is good, because he’s intrinsically good, and I’m an idiot, because I’m intrinsically an idiot, and we’re both sentimental, because our culture tends inexorably toward sentimentality. But when the performance is over and I’m alone, the killer will open the window of my room and come tiptoeing in like a nurse and slit my throat, bleed me dry. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfrvv1fcxkhqdgd7e485mq7n)</span>

The evidence would seem to be incontrovertible. But what she’s seen is only the outside. The shell of literature.

Reading is pleasure and happiness to be alive or sadness to be alive and above all it’s knowledge and questions. Writing, meanwhile, is almost always empty. There’s *nothing* in the guts of the man who sits there writing. Nothing, I mean to say, that his wife, at a given moment, might recognize. He writes like someone taking dictation. His novel or book of poems, decent, adequate, arises not from an exercise of style or will, as the poor unfortunate believes, but as the result of an exercise of *concealment.* There must be many books, many lovely pines, to shield from hungry eyes the book that really matters, the wretched cave of our misfortune, the magic flower of winter! <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfrw104ttgz21ss1vn2jt1nw)</span>

> According to some, the punishment of the rock had only one purpose: to keep Sisyphus occupied and prevent him from hatching new schemes. But at the least expected moment, Sisyphus will devise something and he’ll come back to Earth, Archimboldi ended his letter. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv1ez6sszwj2f97e4f272qw)</span>

> The essayist, who had remained standing in the doorway as Archimboldi examined the room, handed him the keys and assured him that here, though he might not find happiness, which in any case didn’t exist, he would find peace and quiet. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv2ra7q44kjcb8gdmma4sr2)</span>

> As if reading his thoughts, the essayist met his eyes. His expression was perplexed. He knows what I’m thinking and now he thinks the same thing and can’t understand it, just as I can’t understand it, thought Archimboldi. Actually, the look on their faces was more a look of sadness than perplexity. But there’s the apple on the white plate, thought Archimboldi.
> “That apple has a scent at night,” said the essayist. “When I turn out the light. It smells as strongly as Rimbaud’s ‘Voyelles.’ But everything collapses in the end,” said the essayist. “Everything collapses in pain. All eloquence springs from pain.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv2t7kxrq5yq8p1a6hzgnev)</span>

> Sometimes, in an excess of sentimentalism, the baroness asked him to come back to Germany. I have come back, Archimboldi answered. I’d like you to come back for good, answered the baroness. Stay for longer. Now you’re famous. A press conference wouldn’t hurt. Though perhaps that might be too much for you. But at least an exclusive interview with some top cultural reporter. Only in my worst nightmares, Archimboldi wrote her. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv377a4n3428md8xpf0fdtr)</span>

> The second column was made up of ghosts, corpses just risen from a graveyard, specters in gray or verdigris uniforms and steel helmets, invisible to all eyes except Lotte’s, and she repeated her question, which a few scarecrows deigned to answer, saying yes, they’d seen him in Soviet country, fleeing like a coward, or they’d seen him swimming in the Dnieper and then drowning, as he well deserved, or they’d seen him on the Kalmuk Steppe, gulping water as if he were dying of thirst, or they’d seen him crouching in a forest in Hungary, wondering how to shoot himself with his own rifle, or they’d seen him on the edge of a cemetery, the stupid bastard, not daring to go in, pacing back and forth until night fell and the cemetery emptied of relatives and only then, the faggot, did he stop pacing and climb the walls, digging his hobnailed boots into the red, crumbling bricks and poking his nose and blue eyes over the edge, peering down at where the dead lay, the Grotes and the Kruses, the Neitzkes and the Kunzes, the Barzes and the Wilkes, the Lemkes and the Noacks, discreet Ladenthin and brave Voss, and then, emboldened, he climbed to the top of the wall and sat there for a while, his long legs dangling, and then he stuck out his tongue at the dead, and then he took off his helmet and pressed both hands to his temples, and then he closed his eyes and howled, that was what the specters told Lotte, as they laughed and marched behind the column of the living. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv3vtbqwtvkkgz7k278mdxy)</span>

> “It’s unfathomable *and* hostile,” she told him, and only then did she realize that she was a girl again, a girl who lived in a Prussian village between the forest and the sea.

> “No harder than it is for you,” said Isabel Santolaya.

> As the plane crossed the Atlantic, Lotte realized in astonishment that she was reading a part of her childhood.
> The style was strange. The writing was clear and sometimes even transparent, but the way the stories followed one after another didn’t lead anywhere: all that was left were the children, their parents, the animals, some neighbors, and in the end, all that was really left was nature, a nature that dissolved little by little in a boiling cauldron until it vanished completely. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv6bzt11bbgpbgq9z1e38r7)</span>

> “I hope you’ll hear soon from your brother. It’s been a pleasure speaking to you. Goodbye.”
> And she hung up. In Mexico Lotte sat for a while longer with the phone pressed to her ear. The sounds she heard were like the sounds of the abyss. The sounds a person hears as she plummets into the abyss. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfv6mmn31m65ef0zmwsvvx5f)</span>
