# Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

## Thoughts
Absolutely loved this one, although it did fall off a bit off toward the end, but still a satisfying quick read. And now I can watch Blade Runner!

## Highlights
### id765900911

> The subjective response, however, when a Philip Dick book has been finished and put aside is that, upon reflection, it does not seem so much that one holds the memory of a story; rather, it is the after effects of a poem rich in metaphor that seem to remain. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nm4csc2jdv7m18q0mpmmnt)</span>

- [N] Intro to the book

### id765910796

> So I left the TV sound off and I sat down at my mood organ and I experimented. And I finally found a setting for despair.” Her dark, pert face showed satisfaction, as if she had achieved something of worth. “So I put it on my schedule for twice a month; I think that’s a reasonable amount of time to feel hopeless about everything, about staying here on Earth after everybody who’s smart has emigrated, don’t you think?” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nqcstqp3bdb65sj7apn57v)</span>

- [N] Programming "despair" to stay connected to reality. I guess you could say something about the effect of anti-depressants or any drug really. Losing all feeling is dangerous, it's important to find a balance, without one there is no other.

### id765911439

> “Dial 888,” Rick said as the set warmed. “The desire to watch TV, no matter what’s on it.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nqjy2h6dy1hsap12hxd1ww)</span>

### id765913068

> In silence Rick Deckard plucked open the door of his hovercar. He had nothing further to say to his neighbor; his mind was on his work, on the day ahead. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nrh366jdjdpgqy2h9gpy7y)</span>

- [N] This book fucking rules already. Rick and Barbour arguing about their electric animals and being "empaths" as a virtuous way of life in society, Rick wants one of Barbours horses since he only he has an artificial electric sheep, not a real one, his died of tetanus a while back. 

### id765913286

> In a giant, empty, decaying building which had once housed thousands, a single TV set hawked its wares to an uninhabited room. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nrrrpqxmdheggj6wszmhgv)</span>

- [N] Could be a cool shot in a film

### id765918543

> Once pegged as special, a citizen, even if accepting sterilization, dropped out of history. He ceased, in effect, to be part of mankind. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6ns0d0c52cmc81y9nyyg7tj)</span>

- [N] The sun no longer shines on earth due to the dust from the war and the incentive to emigrate to a colony world is a brand new android. If you stick around you'll perhaps be deemed a "special" due to the effects of the dust.

> The silence of the world could not rein back its greed. Not any longer. Not when it had virtually won. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nsh3186ay5x18kj67erp4r)</span>

### id765921096

> Isidore stood holding the two handles, experiencing himself as encompassing every other living thing, and then, reluctantly, he let go. It had to end, as always, and anyhow his arm ached and bled where the rock had struck it. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nt3dcvmw803nhvzgsj8rbn)</span>

- [N] So they use this machine to enter into the life of this prophet guy, Mercer, to teach them about life? Is this some sort of propaganda to strive, ascend, or is it some weird entertainment or game? People actually feel the pain and some elderly even die from the experience. Mercerism, a sort of experience only humans can make sense of, empathy.

### id765921427

> I have to keep calm, he realized. Not let him know I’m a chickenhead. If he finds out I’m a chickenhead he won’t talk to me; that’s always the way it is for some reason. I wonder why? <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6nt9w6xax5ft20hrnz70zjc)</span>

### id765922147

### id765922694

> Empathy, evidently, existed only within the human community, whereas intelligence to some degree could be found throughout every phylum and order including the arachnida. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6ntx235sjprjnr37v9t3fda)</span>

### id765922815

> Empathy, he once had decided, must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could depart from a meat diet. Because, ultimately, the empathic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter and victim, between the successful and the defeated. As in the fusion with Mercer, everyone ascended together or, when the cycle had come to an end, fell together into the trough of the tomb world. Oddly, it resembled a sort of biological insurance, but double-edged. As long as some creature experienced joy, then the condition for all other creatures included a fragment of joy. However, if any living being suffered, then for all the rest the shadow could not be entirely cast off. A herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this; an owl or a cobra would be destroyed. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6ntyrcrhntxwd7q49tn9k59)</span>

- [N] On empathy. Humanoid robots on the other hand are solitary predators, according to Rick.

If our firm hadn’t made these progressively more human types, other firms in the field would have. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tnvkacqks8g7q5hg0t5ez0)</span>

> But eventually I’ll die or go away, and then the kipple will again take over. It’s a universal principle operating throughout the universe; the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total, absolute kippleization.” He added, “Except of course for the upward climb of Wilbur Mercer.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tpy9p1yywbsk6s26vtvjx2)</span>

### id766858650

> “But an empathy box,” he said, stammering in his excitement, “is the most personal possession you have! It’s an extension of your body; it’s the way you touch other humans, it’s the way you stop being alone. But you know that. Everybody knows that. Mercer even lets people like me—” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tpza3hj71jpqkk4n1qe2ma)</span>

- [N] Empathy Box

### id766859595

> This had always amazed him, these “disease” circuits built into false animals; the construct which he now held on his lap had been put together in such a fashion that when a primary component misfired, the whole thing appeared—not broken—but organically ill. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tqadvgbrq3h4f1bq5t1q8n)</span>

- [N] Pretty cool tech

### id766860235

> How did Buster Friendly find the time to tape both his aud and vid shows? Isidore wondered. And how did Amanda Werner find time to be a guest every other day, month after month, year after year? How did they keep talking? They never repeated themselves—not so far as he could determine. Their remarks, always witty, always new, weren’t rehearsed. Amanda’s hair glowed, her eyes glinted, her teeth shone; she never ran down, never became tired, never found herself at a loss as to a clever retort to Buster’s bang-bang string of quips, jokes, and sharp observations. The Buster Friendly Show, telecast and broadcast over all Earth via satellite, also poured down on the emigrants of the colony planets. Practice transmissions beamed to Proxima had been attempted, in case human colonization extended that far. Had the Salander 3 reached its destination, the travelers aboard would have found the Buster Friendly Show awaiting them. And they would have been glad. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tqjkrsdznz8gjspc5g3s55)</span>

- [N] The Buster Friendly Show :) Isidore was annoyed that the show ridiculed the empathy boxes...

### id766861018

> the American and Soviet police had publicly stated that Mercerism reduced crime by making citizens more concerned about the plight of their neighbors. Mankind needs more empathy <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tqp2r61vjk4vmmz3gzb8wn)</span>

### id766861232

> Maybe Buster is jealous, Isidore conjectured. Sure, that would explain it; he and Wilbur Mercer are in competition. But for what?
> Our minds, Isidore decided. They’re fighting for control of our psychic selves; the empathy box on one hand, Buster’s guffaws and off-the-cuff jibes on the other. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tqr1ex591mc0xbdtvas96x)</span>

- [N] Buster vs. Mercerism... buster being the critic of life, free thinker and Wilbur Mercer being authoritarian, seeking control through manufactured "empathy" ?

### id766862079

> “Buster is immortal, like Mercer. There’s no difference.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tr1rpb0yx43vsnvgc6jjb9)</span>

### id766881199

> I’ll pose as an opera fan, Rick decided as he read further. I particularly would like to see her as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. In my personal collection I have tapes by such old-time greats as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Lotte Lehmann and Lisa Della Casa; that’ll give us something to discuss while I set up my Voigt-Kampff equipment. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6ttr1v5zc5gmqhaj285xgav)</span>

- [N] It's crazy how good the casting of Harrison Ford is for this part, even without knowing about it I feel like I'd picture him as Rick Deckard.

### id766882533

> What kind of world is it, he asked himself, when an android phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance? <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6ttwex0raj5r1x1rxasppe9)</span>

### id766883431

> Christ that came close, he said to himself. I must have overreacted to Rachael Rosen’s warning; I went the other way and it almost finished me. But I got Polokov, he said to himself. His adrenal gland, by degrees, ceased pumping its several secretions into his bloodstream; his heart slowed to normal, his breathing became less frantic. But he still shook. Anyhow I made myself a thousand dollars just now, he informed himself. So it was worth it. And I’m faster to react than Dave Holden. Of course, however, Dave’s experience evidently prepared me; that has to be admitted. Dave had not had such warning. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tv4s436a93d3667zah1jna)</span>

- [N] Action packed! Get 'em Deckard!

### id766884615

> As he descended toward the ornate, expansive roof of the opera house he loudly sang a potpourri of arias, with pseudo-Italian words made up on the spot by himself; even without the Penfield mood organ at hand his spirits brightened into optimism. And into hungry, gleeful anticipation. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tvevyp0tw6dpwpq503g7pv)</span>

- [N] Ricks feeling good, love this image

### id766885398

> Thinking this, he wondered if Mozart had had any intuition that the future did not exist, that he had already used up his little time. Maybe I have, too, Rick thought as he watched the rehearsal move along. This rehearsal will end, the performance will end, the singers will die, eventually the last score of the music will be destroyed in one way or another; finally the name “Mozart” will vanish, the dust will have won. If not on this planet then another. We can evade it awhile. As the andys can evade me and exist a finite stretch longer. But I get them or some other bounty hunter gets them. In a way, he realized, I’m part of the form-destroying process of entropy. The Rosen Association creates and I unmake. Or anyhow so it must seem to them. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tvkz9sj92pg3nyqgpk4bsv)</span>

- [N] Ricks getting deep, life and death and the entropy of it all.

> “I’ll take the test,” Luba Luft said, “if you’ll take it first.”
> Again he stared at her, stopped in his tracks. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tw03bxqmd83cbman73grpp)</span>

- [N] Interesting, could Rick be an android? After all, androids are known to have false memories and Rick could be falsely remembering taking the test back in the day...

### id766891562

> Taking the receiver from the harness bull, Rick said, “Mr. Bryant?” He listened, waited; nothing. “I’ll dial again.” He hung up, waited, then redialed the familiar number. The phone rang, but no one answered it; the phone rang on and on. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6twff9b5pjkm105xvnskzvb)</span>

- [N] Uh oh... what's going on with Rick, his reality is bending, what's going on?

### id766908143

> I’ve got to tell him, he said to himself. It’s unethical and cruel not to. Mr. Resch, you’re an android, he thought to himself. You got me out of this place and here’s your reward; you’re everything we jointly abominate. The essence of what we’re committed to destroy. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6txwg5qxfxvx0vdv613d3x4)</span>

### id766908615

> At an oil painting Phil Resch halted, gazed intently. The painting showed a hairless, oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear, its hands clapped in horror to its ears, its mouth open in a vast, soundless scream. Twisted ripples of the creature’s torment, echoes of its cry, flooded out into the air surrounding it; the man or woman, whichever it was, had become contained by its own howl. It had covered its ears against its own sound. The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present; the creature screamed in isolation. Cut off by—or despite—its outcry. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6ty6knz7837589c4fw5d8xp)</span>

- [N] Phil Resch and Rick observe an oil painting, a horrifying depiction of a creature, alone, screaming into emptiness. Does Phil have empathy for this creature, species, androids? Does Rick? What does Phil mean when he says "that's how an Andy must feel" ? 

### id766910169

> “Only in this book of his collected work,” the clerk said, lifting down a handsome glossy volume. “Twenty-five dollars.”
> “I’ll take it.” He reached for his wallet.
> Phil Resch said, “My departmental budget could never in a million years be stretched—”
> “My own money,” Rick said; he handed the woman the bills and Luba the book. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tykb1fkgr54f31jysgpa2n)</span>

- [N] Is Rick displaying empathy here by buying Luba the book she wants before they kill her? Or is it just to shut her up?

### id766911167

> “But someone has to do this,” Phil Resch pointed out.
> “They can use androids. Much better if andys do it. I can’t anymore; I’ve had enough. She was a wonderful singer. The planet could have used her. This is insane.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tyvegk4gxbfe7r1whdd5td)</span>

### id766916313

> So much for the distinction between authentic living humans and humanoid constructs. In that elevator at the museum, he said to himself, I rode down with two creatures, one human, the other android…and my feelings were the reverse of those intended. Of those I’m accustomed to feel—am required to feel. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6tzchxfr70jvz3jhyzgy3hx)</span>

- [N] So Rick has empathy for androids, well, certain androids, Luba at least... or is it sex, or love, as Phil inquires

### id766918837

> “We came back,” Pris said, “because nobody should have to live there. It wasn’t conceived for habitation, at least not within the last billion years. It’s so old. You feel it in the stones, the terrible old age. Anyhow, at first I got drugs from Roy; I lived for that new synthetic painkiller, that silenizine. And then I met Horst Hartman, who at that time ran a stamp store, rare postage stamps; there’s so much time on your hands that you’ve got to have a hobby, something you can pore over endlessly. And Horst got me interested in pre-colonial fiction.”
> “You mean old books?”
> “Stories written before space travel but about space travel.”
> “How could there have been stories about space travel before—”
> “The writers,” Pris said, “made it up.”
> “Based on what?”

### id766919256

> Anyhow there’s plenty here, in the libraries; that’s where we get all of ours—stolen from libraries here on Earth and shot by autorocket to Mars. You’re out at night bumbling across the open space, and all of a sudden you see a flare, and there’s a rocket, cracked open, with old pre-colonial fiction magazines spilling out everywhere.

### id766923685

> And maybe Milt, who was very inventive, could design a weapon for him to use. Something imaginative, which would slay bounty hunters…whatever they were. He had an indistinct, glimpsed darkly impression: of something merciless that carried a printed list and a gun, that moved machine-like through the flat, bureaucratic job of killing. A thing without emotions, or even a face; a thing that if killed got replaced immediately by another resembling it. And so on, until everyone real and alive had been shot. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6v0nachh130je31djhbmm8v)</span>

> “I don’t think we have to worry about Mr. Isidore,” she said earnestly; she walked swiftly toward him, looked up into his face. “They don’t treat him very well either, as he said.

Despite the pain. Physical pain but spiritually together; I felt everyone else, all over the world, all who had fused at the same time.” She held the elevator door from sliding shut. “Get in, Rick.

You said it this morning yourself. ‘Those poor andys.’ So you know what I’m talking about. That’s why I bought the goat. I never felt like that before. Maybe it could be a depression, like you get. I can understand now how you suffer when you’re depressed; I always thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time, if not alone, then by means of the mood organ.

> “How can I save you,” the old man said, “if I can’t save myself?” He smiled. “Don’t you see? There is no salvation.”
> “Then what’s this for?” Rick demanded. “What are you for?”

> “Why?” Rick said. “Why should I do it? I’ll quit my job and emigrate.”
> The old man said, “You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.”

> “Empathy,” he said.
> “Something like that. Identification; there goes I. My god; maybe that’s what’ll happen. In the confusion you’ll retire me, not her. And she can go back to Seattle and live my life. I never felt this way before. We are machines, stamped out like bottle caps. It’s an illusion that I—I personally—really exist; I’m just representative of a type.” She shuddered. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6wtqn88bvf0ctq4whhd88pa)</span>

Ants again; that’s what we are. Not you; I mean me. Chitinous reflex-machines who aren’t really alive.” She twisted her head to one side, said loudly, “I’m not alive!

> In the absence of the Batys and Pris he found himself fading out, becoming strangely like the inert television set which he had just unplugged. You have to be with other people, he thought. In order to live at all. I mean, before they came here I could stand it, being alone in the building. But now it’s changed. You can’t go back, he thought. You can’t go from people to nonpeople.

> Buster Friendly continued. “Ask yourselves what is it that Mercerism does. Well, if we’re to believe its many practitioners, the experience fuses—”
> “It’s that empathy that humans have,” Irmgard said.
> “—men and women throughout the Sol System into a single entity. But an entity which is manageable by the so-called telepathic voice of ‘Mercer.’ Mark that. An ambitious politically minded would-be Hitler could—”
> “No, it’s that empathy,” Irmgard said vigorously. Fists clenched, she roved into the kitchen, up to Isidore. “Isn’t it a way of proving that humans can do something we can’t do? Because without the Mercer experience we just have your word that you feel this empathy business, this shared, group thing. How’s the spider?” She bent over Pris’s shoulder.
> With the scissors, Pris snipped off another of the spider’s legs. “Four now,” she said. She nudged the spider. “He won’t go. But he can.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6wwh8kadd59qjkam42xsqg5)</span>

- [N] Mercerism, is it fusing humans as a single entity or is it empathy, showing that humans can do something that androids cannot. Either way it's a swindle, and to the Andys empathy is too.

> “What did you do?” the man holding the flashlight asked.
> “I put down a spider,” he said, wondering why the man didn’t see; in the beam of yellow light the spider bloated up larger than life. “So it could get away.”
> “Why don’t you take it up to your apartment? You ought to keep it in a jar. According to the January Sidney’s most spiders are up ten percent in retail price. You could have gotten a hundred and some odd dollars for it.”
> Isidore said, “If I took it back up there she’d cut it apart again. Bit by bit, to see what it did.”

- [N] Isidore is over it, his views of androids shifted when she took apart the spiders legs one by one. And then Buster Friendly debunked Mercerism as a scam to convince humans that empathy is a scam. He's had it, his feelings are very real. The spider proves it. His worldview is shattered but will he give up the androids? Does he even understand?

Life which we can no longer distinguish; life carefully buried up to its forehead in the carcass of a dead world. In every cinder of the universe Mercer probably perceives inconspicuous life. Now I know, he thought. And once having seen through Mercer’s eyes, I probably will never stop.

And that—” He hesitated, evidently amazed at what he had begun to say. “That part was worse,” he said. “After I finished. I couldn’t stop because there would be nothing left after I stopped. You were right this morning when you said I’m nothing but a crude cop with crude cop hands.”
