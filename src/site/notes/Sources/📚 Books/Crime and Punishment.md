> This, too, is a prison of sorts: not the prison of Pushkinâ€™s military autocracy, nor the bureaucratic nightmare of Gogol, but the false freedom of those torn from their roots, left with nothing but words and borrowed ideas. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg2hg3e4fasb4pzyqkhskt57)</span>

> â€˜*Crime and Punishment* is focused on the solution of an enigma: the mystery of Raskolnikovâ€™s motivation.â€™[9](private://read/01jg2faahvsbn6sf4a4pzrzawe/#EndnoteNumber8-1097) We may wonder, though, whether this â€˜enigmaâ€™ is not itself a decoy planted by this most devious of writers. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg2j10s6s73jmpn3v70c7bv2)</span>

> Dostoyevsky shows how a man who feels as if he is not alive and not truly capable of affecting reality will affect it for precisely that reasonÂ â€“ and with catastrophic results. In his own estranged perception, not only is his sense of his own reality attenuated, so too is his sense of the reality of his fellow human beings, of the boundaries between separate lives. The eerie astonishment that overcomes Raskolnikov throughout his crime is the eeriness of a dead man meeting and muffling life. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg2j9wnj7mqbqypfrxrk8ad5)</span>

> Etymologically, a crime in Russian is a â€˜stepping-overâ€™ (*pre-stuplenie*), a transgression. To feel alive and free, every person must â€˜step overâ€™ their conscience and the limits imposed on them by themselves and by others. In this sense, everyone has their crime to commit; or, as a certain cynic tells Raskolnikov, everyone has their â€˜steps to takeâ€™. Punishment, too, can be measured in stepsÂ â€“ all the way to SiberiaÂ â€“ but it must be imposed by another to be meaningful. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg2kkty4hgj43e6kbh34m2vz)</span>
