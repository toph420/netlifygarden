# Mumbo Jumbo

> [!summary]+
> **summary**:: *Mumbo Jumbo* is a satirical novel set in the 1920s that explores the cultural conflict between Black and white America. The story revolves around "Jes Grew," a spiritual virus that causes people to dance and embrace Black culture. The "Wallflower Order," a group representing Western civilization, tries to suppress Jes Grew. The novel uses humor, historical references, and elements of Vodou to critique Western society and celebrate Black identity.


> [!Ava]- AI Highlight Analysis
> Ishmael Reed's *Mumbo Jumbo* is a vibrant satire that dissects the cultural landscape of 1920s America, exploring the clash between Black and white cultures through the lens of "Jes Grew," a spiritual epidemic of dance and cultural awakening. Reed masterfully employs humor, historical references, and elements of Vodou to critique Western society while celebrating Black identity and cultural expression.
> 
> At its core, the novel examines the suppression of Black culture by the dominant Western forces, represented by the "Wallflower Order." This suppression is not merely cultural but also spiritual, as Jes Grew is portrayed as a force that threatens the established order. Reed highlights this conflict through the Wallflower Order's mission: "The 2nd Stage of the plan is to groom a Talking Android who will work within the Negro...to drive it out, categorize it analyze it expell it slay it, blot Jes Grew." This quote encapsulates the fear and determination of the Western establishment to control and eradicate Black cultural influence.
> 
> The theme of cultural appropriation is also prevalent, with Reed pointing out the hypocrisy of Western artists and intellectuals who borrow from Black culture without acknowledging its true value. As one character notes, European artists are "flocking to it, Stravinsky writing Ragtime pieces … Picasso painting like an African," yet this appropriation often strips the original culture of its significance. Abdul's monologue further emphasizes this point, criticizing the double standards in how Black cultural contributions are perceived versus those of the dominant culture: "If we Blacks came up with something as corny as the Angel of Moroni...they would deride us."
> 
> *Mumbo Jumbo* also delves into the idea of cultural identity and the search for authenticity. The character Berbelang embodies this theme, seeking to understand and preserve the essence of Black culture against the encroaching forces of Western assimilation. Berbelang’s explanation of Faust connects this to a deeper historical context, suggesting that Western culture is haunted by a "wound," a sense of inauthenticity and a tendency towards exploitation: "Western man doesn’t know the difference between a *houngan* and a *bokor.*"
> 
> Ultimately, *Mumbo Jumbo* celebrates the resilience and dynamism of Black culture. Jes Grew, as a metaphor for this cultural vitality, is portrayed as an unstoppable force that continuously reinvents itself. As the novel concludes, "Jes Grew has no end and no beginning...It will try to depress Jes Grew but it will only spring back and prosper." This cyclical view of cultural conflict suggests that the struggle for cultural recognition and expression is an ongoing process, with Black culture continually reemerging and influencing the world.

The thing that works here will have a little bit of jive talk and a little bit of North Africa, a fez-wearing mulatto in a pinstriped suit. A man who can say give me some skin as well as Asalamilakum. Haven’t you heard? This is the country where something is successful in direct proportion to how it’s put over; how it’s gamed. Look at the Mormons. Did they recruit 1000s of whites to their cause by conjuring the Druids? No, they used material the people were familiar with and added their own. The most fundamental book of the Mormon Church, the Book of Mormon, is a fraud. If we Blacks came up with something as corny as the Angel of Moroni, something as trite and phony as their story that the book is the record of ancient Americans who came here in 600 B.C. and perished by A.D. 400, they would deride us with pejorative adjectival phrases like “so-called” and “would-be.” They would refuse to exempt our priests from the draft, a privilege extended to every White hayseed’s fruit stand which calls itself a Church. But regardless of the put-on, the hype, the Mormons got Utah, didn’t they? Perhaps I will come up with something that will have a building shaped like a mosque, the interior furnishings Victorian, the priests dressed in Catholic garb, and soul food as offerings.

### id858647231

> … Faust was an actual person. Somewhere between 1510 and 1540 this “wandering conjurer and medical quack” made his travels about the southwest German Empire, telling people his knowledge of “secret things.” I always puzzled over why such a legend was so basic to the Western mind; but I’ve thought about it and now I think I know the answer. Can’t you imagine this man traveling about with his bad herbs, love philters, physicks and potions, charms, overcharging the peasants but dazzling them with his badly constructed Greek and sometimes labeling his “wonder cures” with gibberish titles like “Polyunsaturated 99½% pure.” Hocus-pocus. He makes a living and can always get a free night’s lodging at an inn with his ability to prescribe cures and tell fortunes, that is, predict the future. You see he travels about the Empire and is able to serve as a kind of national radio for people in the locales. Well 1 day while he is leeching people, cutting hair or raising the dead who only have diseases which give the manifestations of death, something really works. He knows that he’s a *bokor* adept at card tricks, but something really works. He tries it again and it works. He continues to repeat this performance and each time it works. The peasants begin to look upon him as a supernatural being and he encourages the tales about him, that he heals the sick and performs marvels. He becomes wealthy with his ability to do The Work. Royalty visits him. He is a counselor to the king. He lives in a castle. Peasants whisper, a Black man, a very bearded devil himself visits him. That strange coach they saw, the 1 with the eyes as decorations drawn to his castle by wild-looking black horses. They say that he has made a pact with the devil because he invites the Africans who work in various cities throughout the Empire to his castle. There were 1000s in Europe at the time: blackamoors who worked as butlers, coachmen, footmen, pint-sized page boys; and conjurors whom only the depraved consulted. The villagers hear “Arabian” music, drums coming from the place but as soon as the series of meetings begin it all comes to a halt. Rumors circulate that Faust is dead. The village whispers that the Black men have collected. That is the nagging notion of Western man. China had rocketry, Africa iron furnaces, but he didn’t know when to stop with his newly found Work. That’s the basic wound. He will create fancy systems 13 letters long to convince himself he doesn’t have this wound. What is the wound? Someone will even call it guilt. But guilt implies a conscience. Is Faust capable of charity? No it isn’t guilt but the knowledge in his heart that he is a *bokor.* A charlatan who has sent 1000000s to the churchyard with his charlatan panaceas. Western man doesn’t know the difference between a *houngan* and a *bokor.* He once knew this difference but the knowledge was lost when the Atonists crushed the opposition. When they converted a Roman emperor and began rampaging and book-burning. His sorcery, white magic, his *bokorism* will improve. Soon he will be able to annihilate 1000000s by pushing a button. I do not believe that a Yellow or Black hand will push this button but a robot-like descendant of Faust the quack will. The dreaded *bokor*, a humbug who doesn’t know when to stop. We must purge the *bokor* from you. We must teach you the difference between a healer, a holy man, and a duppy who returns from the grave and causes mischief. We must infuse you with the mysteries that Jes Grew implies. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnangw81pfvj6sc862erpn62)</span>

> Ornamenting the desk are amusing lampoons carved in wood, ivory, and cast in bronze by African sculptors. They depict Whites who went into Africa seeking skins, ivory, spices, feathers and furs. The subjects are represented giving bribes, drinking gin, leading manacled slaves, wearing curious, outlandish hats and holding umbrellas. Their chalk-faces appear silly, ridiculous. Outstanding in the collection is the figure of a monkey-like Portuguese explorer, carved by an Angolan. He is obviously juiced and is sitting on a barrel. What side-splitting, bellyaching, satirical ways these ancient craftsmen brought to their art! The African race had quite a sense of humor. In North America, under Christianity, many of them had been reduced to glumness, depression, surliness, cynicism, malice without artfulness, and their intellectuals, in America, only appreciated heavy, serious works. (’Tis the cause, Desdemona.) They’d really fallen in love with tragedy. Their plays were about bitter, raging members of the “nuclear family,” and their counterpart in art was exemplified by the contorted, grimacing, painful social-realist face. Somebody, head in hands, sitting on a stoop. “Lawd, I’z so re-gusted.” Bert Williams had captured the Afro-American mask with Northrop Frye’s inverted U lips. But the figures on the desk, these grotesque, laughable wooden ivory and bronze cartoons represent the genius of Afro satire. They had been removed to Europe by the slavers, traders and sailors who had taken gunpowder and uniforms to Africa. They did not realize that the joke was on them. After all, how could “primitive” people possess wit. LaBas could understand the certain North American Indian tribe reputed to have punished a man for lacking a sense of humor. For LaBas, anyone who couldn’t titter a bit was not Afro but most likely a Christian connoting blood, death, and impaled emaciated Jew in excruciation. Nowhere is there an account or portrait of Christ laughing. Like the Marxists who secularized his doctrine, he is always stern, serious and as gloomy as a prison guard. Never does 1 see him laughing until tears appear in his eyes like the roly-poly squint-eyed Buddha guffawing with arms upraised, or certain African loas, Orishas. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnapftwfr2b65erzn7jm9hc7)</span>

Ragtime. Jazz. Blues. The new thang. That talk you drum from your lips. Your style. What you have here is an experimental art form that all of us believe bears watching. So don’t ask me how to catch Jes Grew. Ask Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, your poets, your painters, your musicians, ask them how to catch it. Ask those people who be shaking their tambourines impervious of the ridicule they receive from Black and White Atonists, Europe the ghost rattling its chains down the deserted halls of their brains. Ask those little colored urchins who “make up” those new dance steps and the loa of the Black cook who wrote the last lines of the “Ballad of Jesse James.” Ask the man who, deprived of an electronic guitar, picked up a washboard and started to play it. The Rhyming Fool who sits in Rē’-mōte Mississippi and talks “crazy” for hours.

Riff fly skid dip soar and gave his Alto Godspeed. Jes Grew that touched John Coltrane’s Tenor; that tinged the voice of Otis Redding and compelled Black Herman to write a dictionary to Dreams that Freud would have envied. Jes Grew was the manic in the artist who would rather do glossolalia than be “neat clean or lucid.” Jes Grew, the despised enemy of the Atonist Path, those Left-Handed practitioners of the Petro Loa, those too taut to spring from sharp edges, wiggle jiggle go all the way down and come up shaking. Jes Grew is the lost liturgy seeking its litany. Its words, chants held in bondage by the mysterious Order “which saved the 2nd Crusade from annihilation by Islamic hordes.” Those disgraced Knights. Jes Grew needed its words to tell its carriers what it was up to. Jes Grew was an influence which sought its text, and whenever it thought it knew the location of its words and Labanotations it headed in that direction. There had been a sporadic episode in the 1890s and it was driven back into its Cell. Jes Grew was jumpy now because it was 1920 and something was going on. A Stirring. If it could not find its Text then it would be mistaken for entertainment.
