> His dark room now seemed cool and restfully confining. You could imagine maps in the wallpaper. The roses had faded into vague shells of pink. Only a few silver lines along the vanished stems and in the veins of leaves, indistinct patches of the palest green, remainedâ€”the faint suggestion of mysterious geography. A grease spot was a marsh, a mountain or a treasure. Israbestis went boating down a crack on cool days, under the tree boughs, bending his head. He fished in a chip of plaster. The perch rose to the bait and were golden in the sunwater. Specks stood for cities; pencil marks were bridges; stains and shutter patterns laid out fields of wheat and oats and corn. In the shadow of a corner the crack issued into a great sea. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jswx7040yqjbg00hk3tm478v)</span>

> He sent himself on journeys with an effort that brought sweat to his brow and moistened his palms and the back of his ears. He took ship down the faint crack rivers. He cut his way through matted, tortuous jungles designated by the pale leaves. He trudged across vast blanks of desert and drank thirstily at muddy holes. The days that he was in the wall he thought of himself primarily as a sailor. He conjured up bright images of sail, green swells on the reaches of the ocean, the brown slabs of river mouths and the awesome blue chop and the trailing spray of troubled weather. Climbing the shrouds, the springs of the bed squeaking like a rolling deck and hull and like the tackle in the block, he would sight a dark cloud puffing from the horizon. Funneling up, it would run at the ship and Israbestis would hitch himself on his elbow, waving his other arm free of the clothes, and shout, "Look out, she's coming on, look out, look out," for he knew no nautical terms and nothing of seamanly action. Pain would storm at his eyes. Sweat would drip from his nose. "She's a blower, captain, aye, she's a roller, captain," Israbestis would cry. "The worst I've seen in these seas." The hiss of his words was like the spray from the bow. Israbestis screamed in order to be heard above the wind in the rigging that was howling in the shrouds and through the ports of the ship. Then all of a sudden it would be gone. He would watch the paling cloud and the dimpled water disappear before he fell, for a moment, asleep. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jswxe9z3fn25j11ymtcf7q20)</span>

> Henry loved to tell of everything he saw when he passed Omensetter's house, though he was cowardly and quiet about the fox, and neither he nor his listeners ever thought how strange it was they took such interest in the smallest things their newest neighbor did, for Omensetter cast an interest like a shade. It was as though one could, by knowing when his beans went in or when he cut his firewood for washing, hoed, or simply walked a morning in the oak and maple woods like a tree among the trees himself, learn his secret, whatever his secret was, since it must somehow be the sum of these small things all grown together, for as Doctor Orcutt was so fond of pointing out, every measle was a sign of the disease, or as Mat Watson said, every turn of wind or rift of cloud was a parcel of the acreage of weather. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jszj13bkdm4rbv4r04bpmj90)</span>

> That Omensetter had a secret no one doubted now. Gossip was continuous, opinion split, the atmosphere political. One would have thought it France. Henry's own salvation was the central thing, and Henry was frequently vexed to the point of tears, weak as he still was, by the constant queries, the noisy quarrels, the wild conjectures of his friends. Nothing escaped them: chance was reperceived as calculation, distant possibilities were carried briskly into likelihood, the flimsiest hypotheses spun into woolens for a tapestry, and each conclusion was communicated to the town like a disease. At first consigned by nearly everyone to God and so to the faith of Reverend Furber, though always by a smaller group to Science and hence to the skill of Doctor Orcutt, the curâ€”except for a scattered few who insisted upon the will and constitution of Henry himselfâ€”was now almost universally awarded to the beet root poultice and the luck of Brackett Omensetter. But what did this amount to? This credited the cure to ... what? Edna Hoxie had an increase of trade, though Maggie Scanlonâ€”unwedded, largeâ€”scoffed at the question.

> He would sit so quietly within the shadows behind the forge that visitors scarcely noticed he was there. It was like the effect of his illness, for after a period of pain and confusion he thought his eyes had cleared and he had watched from his bed as if from out of the world. It had been as he imagined it was like to be invisible. Your eyes were open. People looked into them but they didn't think you saw. They were less than a mirror, no more than a painting of eyes. The sickness was nothing. Many times he had struggled to say that he could hear. Being stretched to pieces was nothing. Many times he'd tried to shout I can see, I can see youâ€”hissing instead. Fighting for breath was nothing. Burning was nothing. Locked in a shrinking boot of flesh, hour after hour he remembered Jethro Furber's prayers. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jszmh8475bq4bhvanhnnngcn)</span>

> Henry ignored his wife's voice; dipped his hand in the wind. The leaves were learning of the cold. He turned his palm, allowing the wind to pass between his fingers. Cool as hill water it seemed to flow from the pale clouds. This is how it feels, he thought, to run through the cup of Omensetter's hands. Time goes coolly through the funnel of his fingers -click, click, clickâ€”like water over stones. When he had lately felt the wind he seldom had another feeling; yet there were moments, as if in dream, when he could plunge his hand into the air and feel the stream at the lip of Being, and the hesitating water. There was a bather at the precipice with breasts as great as God's, nippled as the berry bush, bright as frost. Corn golden hair was gathered to His thighs. Not in my image. Nothing like me. But in the dream that disabled him, he was afloat on the brink, poised above the incredible gulf like a bird, while each minute frightened him by passing over. With his hands on his ears he could feel them falling. Below lay an empty plain where the bright stream dried. It then became a road that thinned to a rail in the cold horizon. He heard the roar of a miracle coming, a long beak looking for snakes. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jsznffwc9rsdcz8eyawf85gn)</span>

- [N] Gemini Summary: This passage masterfully contrasts Henry Pimber's tortured inner world with his idealized perception of Omensetter. Henry feels alienated from nature, God, and even the simple passage of time, which terrifies him. He projects onto Omensetter a natural grace and effortless existence that he desperately lacks. The passage uses powerful sensory details (wind, cold) and symbolic imagery (water, precipice, the bather, the dried stream, the predatory miracle) to depict Henry's profound anxiety, guilt, numbness, and his terrifying sense of impending doom or judgment. It's a glimpse into a psyche deeply troubled and envious of a perceived, perhaps imagined, state of natural harmony. #ðŸ”¥

> The path took Henry Pimber past the slag across the meadow creek where his only hornbeam hardened slowly in the southern shadow of the ridge and the trees of the separating wood began in rows as the lean road in his dream began, narrowing to nothing in the blank horizon, for train rails narrow behind anybody's journey; and he named them as he passed them: elm, oak, hazel, larch and chestnut tree, as though he might have been the fallen Adam passing them and calling out their soft familiar names, as though familiar names might make some friends for him by being spoken to the unfamiliar and unfriendly world which he was told had been his paradise. In God's name, when was that? When had that been? For he had hated every day he'd lived. Ash, birch, maple. Every day he thought would last forever, and the night forever, and the dawn drag eternally another long and empty day to light forever; yet they sped away, the day, the night clicked past as he walked by the creek by the hornbeam tree, the elders, sorrels, cedars and the fir; for as he named them, sounding their soft names in his lonely skull, the fire of fall was on them, and he named the days he'd lost. It was still sorrowful to die. Eternity, for them, had ended. And he would fall, when it came his time, like an unseen leaf, the bud that was the glory of his birth forgot before remembered. He named the aspen, beech, and willow, and he said aloud the locust when he saw it leafless like a battlefield. In God's name, when was that? When had that been? <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jszpks3d2reywgz3qr62j353)</span>

- [N] Henry naming the trees as he passes them, clinging to his past, attempting to define order, to the lost connection with the world

Gemini Summary: This passage plunges deeper into Henry Pimber's psyche, revealing his profound alienation, despair, and obsession with time and mortality. The act of naming trees is a fragile ritual, an attempt to find order and connection in a world he perceives as hostile and fallen. It contrasts sharply with his internal reality: a life where every day is hated, time is both agonizingly slow and terrifyingly fast, and death promises only insignificance. The landscape mirrors his desolation, and the comparison to a fallen Adam underscores his sense of loss and separation from any form of grace or paradise. He is trapped in a cycle of naming external objects while simultaneously cataloging his own internal losses.


### id883299657

> It was since his sickness ... Everything began withâ€”since his sickness. Once to petrify and die had been his wish; simply to petrify had been his fear; but he had been a stone with eyes and seen as a stone sees: the world as the world is really, without the least prejudice of heart or artifice of mind, and he had come into such truth as only a stone can stand. He yearned to be hard and cold again and have no feeling, for since his sickness he'd been preyed upon by dreams, sleeping and waking, and by sudden rushes of unnaturally sharp, inhuman vision in which all things were dazzling, glorious, and terrifying. He saw then, he thought, as Omensetter saw, except for painful beauty. If there were just a way to frighten off the pain. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jszqg6apzh2dfn0rjb20ykes)</span>

- [N] Henry is having thoughts, as new person, since his sickness, someone that has been close to death and taken stock of his life before it, terrified by this new "feeling", smacked with the reality that he had just been a stone, cold and hard, without feeling.

> Not Adam but inhuman. Was that why he loved him, Henry wondered. It wasn't for his lifeâ€”a curse, god knew; it wasn't for the beet-root poultice. It lay somewhere in the chance of being new ... of living lucky, and of losing Henry Pimber. He had always crammed humanity in everything. Even the air felt guilty. Once he would have seen each tree along this slope boned humanly and branched with feeling like the black bile tree, the locust, despondent even at the summit of the highest summer. How convenient it had been to find his friends and enemies embarked in tame slow trunks, in this or that bent tree, their aspirations safely in high branches and their fires podded into quiet seed. He could pat their bodies with his hands and carve his name and make up animal emotions for them no fruit could contradict. It was always easier to love great trees than people. Such trees were honest. Their deaths showed. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jszr48s7g03gcfzz7y0s2qyp)</span>

> The wind might blow here constantly, it would alter nothing; but this was the season of change, Henry's coat billowed out from him, and Omensetter's countenance escaped into the valley. An immense weariness took hold of Henry now, though the sun in the notch was warming. Of courseâ€”he'd been a foolâ€”Omensetter lived by *not* observingâ€”by joining himself to what he knew. Necessity flew birds as easily as the wind drove these leaves, and they never felt the curvature which drew the arc of their pursuit Nor would a fox cry beauty before he chewed. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jszreh96cm2kdrmzqyxaaxsv)</span>

The sailor of the wind is loose, he thought; my life is lost down this dead hill. He had raised his arms and now he let them fall. I'm dreadfully sick ... stupidly sick. A scientific fact. Quiet giggles shook him. And I've scarcely been alive. Henry Winslow Pimber. Now dead of weak will and dishonest weather. Some such disease. How would that look carved on my stone? He stumbled. ". . for sweet sakes, Hennie, you'll never have a stone..." I shall be my own stone, then, my dear, my own dumb memorial, just as all along I've been my death and burial, my own dry wellâ€”hole, wall, and darkness. I ought to be exposed upon a mountain where the birds can pick my body, for no one could put himself on purpose in this clay. Besides, anyone who's lived so slow and stupidly as I have ought to spend his death up high. His mouth filled. Poor, foolish, stupid bastard, foolish fellow ... foolish wards ...But I'd have made a worthier Omensetterâ€”all new fat, wild hair, and furry testicles like a tiger's. Henry spat. A scientific fact. The saliva drifted against his coat. And when I arrived in my wagon like a careless western hero, clouds would be swimming in the river. Rain would fall beyond us in the forest, the Ohio like a bright hair ribbon ... Gileanâ€”a dream. Lalee. Naa-thing.

> Once before, but in an entirely different manner, he had received a revelation. He was eleven, still a sexless child, weak even then, with signs of palsy and an affinity for fear so pronounced that he had driven his parents nearly out of their wits with it. At that time he sought out terror as though it were a sweetly scented flower. Black and white, bowlegged with a blind eye, Mrs. Kermit Hazen's bulldog would rush across the lawn from his customary place beneath a bush to snap at Furber's shadow where it fell between the picket. All too often they found Jethro lying unconscious there, and then his mother and father would embrace one another, weeping, wondering what in the world they were going to do with their child and why he had been taken with these strange demented ways, so cruel and unnatural. They denied him every book they had not carefully examined themselves, just as they forbade him the Hazen's fence and later the stone quarry and the bluffs beyond town, and finally all farmyards because of the geese and railroad stations because of the engines, then funerals, cemeteries, zoos, and circuses, cellars, closets, attics, deep woods and vacant houses, athletic contests, fires, rallies and revival meetingsâ€”indeed any form of public excitementâ€”and they tried to shelter him from the noise and violence of storms too, as well as from every other remarkable exertion of nature; but none of these prohibitions proved of any use for he wantonly disobeyed them, and his father's threats, his mother's hysterical seizures, their hours of mourning and commiseration, since they were things he greatly feared, he sought as eagerly as he sought the bulldog, or accounts of cannibals in books, or the dizziness which always overcame him in high places.
> To forbid him the Bible was unthinkable, and since it was a book he might be safely seen with, Jethro Furber's knowledge of it was complete at an early age. He read how they stoned a man for gathering sticks on the sabbath. It was easy to imagine himself in a circle of stones and implacable facesâ€”the faces the worstâ€”for had he not been stung by pebbles and knocked down by a clod of dirt and beaten, too, by his companions? <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jta1n780frydxesmy5x89p6k)</span>

- [N] Arsenius: A prominent figure in Christian monasticism, Saint Arsenius (c. 350 â€“ c. 445) was a Roman senator who renounced his wealth and social status to lead a life of asceticism in the Egyptian desert. Known for his piety and wisdom, he became a spiritual guide to many monks and is celebrated for his deep commitment to prayer and contemplation. His life story is often recounted in hagiographies, emphasizing his rejection of material possessions and his dedication to a humble, solitary existence.

> Pike speaks: the way the world is, you have to look down to see up.

You have to look round to see straight. Good enough. Useful. And the rough places plain. But all that's geometry. But it measures the earth. You have to go slow to catch up. Eat to get thin? no, but fast to grow fat, that was a fine one. Then lose to win? fail to succeed? Risky. Stop to begin. The form made noiseless musicâ€”lumly lum lum or lum-lee-lee lumâ€”like fill to empty, every physical extreme. Die to live was a bit old hat. But default to repay. And lie to be honest.

> Then there was the friendly enmity of sun and snow, and the sweet disharmony of every union, the greasy mate of cock and cunt, the cosmic poles, the war that's peace, the stumble that's an everlasting poise and balance, spring and fall, love, strife, health, disease, and the cold duplicity of Number One and all its warm divisions. The sameness that's in difference. The limit that's limitless. The permanence that's change. The distance of the near at home. Soâ€”to roam, stay home. Then pursue to be caught, submit to conquer. Methodâ€”ancient â€”of Chinese. To pacify, inflame. Love, hate. Kiss, kill. In, out, up, down, start, stop. Ah ... from pleasure, pain. Like circumcision of the heart. Judgment and mercy. Sin and grace. It little mattered; everything seemed to Furber to be magically right, and his heart grew fat with satisfaction. Therefore there is good in every evil; one must lower away to raise; seek what's found to mourn its loss; conceive in stone and execute in water; turn profound and obvious, miraculous and commonplace, around; sin to save; destroy in order to create; live in the sun, though underground. Yes. Doubt in order to believeâ€”that was an old oneâ€”for thus the square *is* in the circle. O Phaedo, Phaedo. O endless ending. Soul is immortal after allâ€”at last it's proved.

> How he hated sleep. The worldâ€”how did it dareâ€”went on without him while he slept, went on happilyâ€”this was proofâ€”for everything he wanted and missed and felt should exist existed just beneath him, as close at hand while out of reach as his own insides, yet tomorrow when he was released and woke and went downstairs the rooms would be stale and unfriendly, a forgotten saucer, maybe, would disgust him, and his parents would be lethargic, cross, and awkward with objects. It had finally occurred to him that he was the figure that altered the sum, just as his presence on the beach so much later had subtracted from everyone's pleasure. So his family and his family's friends were happy because he slept. If he died in the night as he sometimes hoped, thinking to punish them, they would not weep but would pass the hours of his death dipping cookies in their coffee, chuckling, and swirling cream in their frail scalloped cups. Tree, ball, wagon: they were greener, firmer, smoother without him. Hoops, the street: it was intolerable they did not need him, but when he lay in his bed they *were* more completely. Sleep was bearable only if the whole world slept, he'd decided; yes, we must all sleep together, that was just; and these thoughts, the words "sleep together," without his in the least understanding why at the time, had suddenly awakened the monster in him. Then he'd cruelly scraped his ears and listened at the stairhead like a deer. He thought he heard their clothing parting. Certainly they giggled at the flesh they showed. He saw through the barriers of wall and floor the pale tangle of their limbs. Later he understood what people feared in fearing ghosts. Strange forms smoked along the stairs. Shapes moved vaguely in sheets. Holding his throat he'd risen and wobbled to his bed and sought sleep as he'd sought it ever since: as a friend and loverâ€”further: as a medicine and god. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtc9rs7rsfp4rvya7mhc9pxs)</span>

> I am inhabited, Furber said. Ah god, I am possessed. He would sit in his study for hours, searching his mind for some clue to the nature of the creature, the source of what he grimly called "Omensetter's magic," while from his window he would watch the pigeons wheeling to occupy his eyes. Finally he sought out Omensetter himself when Omensetter was strolling in the fields. Why do you inhabit me, he cried, why do you possess my tongue and turn it from the way it wants to go? Leave me, Omensetter, leave us all. He came abruptly on the man, blurting out his speech before his resolution left him and shouting in his excitement, though the words came just as he'd prepared and frequently rehearsed them. Omensetter halted and turned slowly to face Furber, who must have seemed to have lit like a crow behind him. The fellow's eyes were huge, their gaze steady; his whole body was listening, pointing toward Furber like a beast; yes, like a beast, a cow, exactly: wary, stupid, dumb; yes, as he thought back there was nothing in his manner that could be ascribed to an animal higher, and he had never replied; yet Omensetter had not come to church again, he had returned to skipping stones on the river where the people saw his example and said he was a godless man, while Furber preached against frivolity with heat. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtcb69mcsq1qzer7c1b7dgpp)</span>

But how could man beget unless his flesh could rise and what was there in innocence to move the simplest muscle in a gesture of desire? Were men to love unmindful, below the beasts, like flowers? It is impossible to know, of course. That moment has passed for all time. Yet watching Omensetter I sometimes think Iâ€™m trembling on the lip of understanding it. It's then I think I recognize the nature of his magic. For whatever Omensetter does he does without desire in the ordinary sense, with a kind of abandon, a stony mindlessness that makes me always think of Eden. The thought is blasphemous, I realize.

He could imagine, looking at it, how chaos was before the first word. It was a striped waste, a visibly starless night. Dust, chambered in rods, lazily settled in no direction. Indistinctly he could see the tops of those fleshy cabinets which would compartment hell, while above, spanning the peak, were the long bars of heaven and the perching choirs of love. He thought of his voice passing into it, dust dancing to its tune. There'd be land in the shape of his syllables, a sea singing, sky like an echo, plants in bloom burning with speech, animals with yellow answering eyes, and finally men taking form from the chant of their names and gathering in crowds to enlarge their reply to the laments which had created them. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtmak7v5ydbnh2g4m0s8fpb9)</span>

You could see what your life would be. You knowâ€”like the gypsy woman who can take your fortune from your hand. Well I took those tracks to be a promise to me... And on the way we'd all been singing. *Rose Alymer*. I heard it sung so strangely once I never forgot it. The words are high and fine beyond my understanding but I like their sound. And we counted kinds of birds... I guess you thinkâ€”well, what does it matter? I don't know ... I remember there were rings in the pools of water by the road, and I thought how exciting for the boy to live by the river, to catch fish and keep frogs, you know; grow up with good excitement. Now he's gone sick, Curtis, in this low place, and there's no honest snow to cover it or cold to hold it firmly even, and the hill we came by is still a slippery yellow. The boy is going to die, Curtis. I just feelâ€”I'm scared he's going to die. He's dreadful sick, I know. You've seen him, you and Olus know he's going to die. Whyâ€”he's barely been alive ... The boyâ€”the boy, tooâ€”he was a promise to me. I hold he was a promise to me. If he diesâ€”well you were allâ€”tooâ€”promises. Curtis? Olus? George? Remember? Wasn't there a promise to me? He'll die soon, my son willâ€”soon he'll be dead of this low ground and its dishonest weather. I'll cut that on his stone. If he ever has a stone.
