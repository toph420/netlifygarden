> Scientific inquiry, he believed, was above all inquiry into the causes of things; and there were four different kinds of cause: the material cause, the efficient cause, the formal cause, and the final cause. To give a crude illustration of what he had in mind: when Alfredo cooks a risotto, the material causes of the risotto are the ingredients that go into it, the efficient cause is the chef himself, the recipe is the formal cause, and the satisfaction of the clients of his restaurant is the final cause. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmma09q14x724339z8cn2g2)</span>

### id860062442

> Plato, among others, tells the following tale:
> Thales was studying the stars and gazing into the sky, when he fell into a well, and a jolly and witty Thracian servant girl made fun of him, saying that he was crazy to know about what was up in the heavens while he could not see what was in front of him beneath his feet. *(Theaetetus* 174a)

- [N] Funny story about Thales

### id860074005

> Like Thales he was credited with a number of original scientific achievements: the first map of the world, the first star chart, the first Greek sundial, and an indoor clock as well. He taught that the earth was cylindrical in shape, like a stumpy column no higher than a third of its diameter. Around the world were gigantic tyres full of fire; each tyre was punctured with a hole through which the fire could be seen from outside, and the holes were the sun and moon and stars. Blockages in the holes accounted for eclipses of the sun and phases of the moon. The celestial fire which is nowadays largely hidden was once a great ball of flame around the infant earth; when this ball exploded, the fragments grew tyres like bark around themselves. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmn5e1zenezk6v82pysy6h8)</span>

- [N] Anaximander of Miletus (d. c.547 BC). lol this is a crazy view of the earth and cosmos

### id860074391

> The fundamental principle of things, he said, must be boundless or undefined *(apeiron)*. Anaximander’s Greek word is often rendered as ‘the Infinite’, but that makes it sound too grand. He may or may not have thought that his principle extended for ever in space; what we do know is that he thought it had no beginning and no end in time and that it did not belong to any particular kind or class of things. ‘Everlasting stuff’ is probably as close a paraphrase as we can get. Aristotle was later to refine the notion into his concept of prime matter. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmnbamjpetx1c6ep2m853yc)</span>

- [N] Anaximander "Everlasting Stuff"

### id860074666

> He saw the universe as a field of competing opposites: hot and cold, wet and dry. Sometimes one of a pair of opposites is dominant, sometimes the other: they encroach upon each other and then withdraw, and their interchange is governed by a principle of reciprocity. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmne7bznzv8k5xrjpe8ghjr)</span>

- [N] Anaximander on competing opposites

### id860074833

> Like Thales, he thought that the earth must rest on something, but he proposed air, rather than water, for its cushion. The earth itself is flat, and so are the heavenly bodies. These, instead of rotating above and below us in the course of a day, circle horizontally around us like a bonnet rotating around a head (KRS 151–6). The rising and setting of the heavenly bodies is explained, apparently, by the tilting of the flat earth. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmnhb41snzp8p23fgkjx5tg)</span>

- [N] Anaximenes (fl. 546–525 BC) on earth and cosmos

### id860075215

> Air is divine, and generates deities out of itself (KRS 144–6); air is our soul, and holds our bodies together (KRS 160). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmnn5wz3d4dqbabjb6078sb)</span>

- [N] Pythagoras invented the word "philosopher"

### id860075677

> The Pythagoreans’ discovery that there was a relationship between musical intervals and numerical ratios led to the belief that the study of mathematics was the key to the understanding of the structure and order of the universe. Astronomy and harmony, they said, were sister sciences, one for the eyes and one for the ears (Plato, *Rep*. 530d). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmnttw0r1bc5myz85r93xq2)</span>

- [N] Big math and numbers guys

### id860076155

> The dietary rules were connected with Pythagoras’ beliefs about the soul. It did not die with the body, he believed, but migrated elsewhere, perhaps into an animal body of a different kind.[3](private://read/01jnm91m9rh438fy4w3n6a77ns/#fn004) Some Pythagoreans extended this into belief in a three-thousand-year cosmic cycle: a human soul after death would enter, one after the other, every kind of land, sea, or air creature, and finally return into a human body for history to repeat itself (Herodotus 2. 123; KRS 285). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmnz385zxsxz42e8ghxn6rr)</span>

- [N] The soul migrated after death of the body 

### id860076203

> Xenophanes <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmp0hx2pgm9cq2dh7xx37at)</span>

### id860076440

> The basic element, he maintained, was not water nor air, but earth, and the earth reaches down below us to infinity. ‘All things are from earth and in earth all things end’ (D.K. 21 B27) calls to mind Christian burial services and the Ash Wednesday exhortation ‘remember, man, thou art but dust and unto dust thou shalt return’. But Xenophanes elsewhere links water with earth as the original source of things, and indeed he believed that our earth must at one time have been covered by the sea. This is connected with the most interesting of his contributions to science: the observation of the fossil record. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmp33z1dp3wsfq18q593jv5)</span>

- [N] Xenophanes cosmology, big earth guy, water too. And the fossil record

### id860076953

> the sun, he maintained, was new every day. It came into existence each morning from a congregation of tiny sparks, and later vanished off into infinity. The appearance of circular movement is due simply to the great distance between the sun and ourselves. It follows from this theory that there are innumerable suns, just as there are innumerable days, because the world lasts for ever even though it passes through aqueous and terrestrial phases (KRS 175, 179). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmp6da5w6jje1gf0208knrs)</span>

- [N] Hmm, not quite Xenophanes. Also believed earth was infinite underneath us.

### id860077385

> God did not tell us mortals all when time began  
> Only through long-time search does knowledge come to man. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmpa96qn18r0b4999h07sfz)</span>

- [N] Xeonophanes despised popular superstition (ie rainbows are just multi color clouds), but was a big monotheistic guy

### id860077794

> Heraclitus <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmpc3mh8gc6evefsvzmqtbe)</span>

### id860077877

> He was nicknamed ‘the Enigmatic One’ and ‘Heraclitus the Obscure’ <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmpdyvb1ws6zzb6bdgr9j2g)</span>

- [N] Heraclitus, not real easy to understand. Hegel and Socrates really dig this guy, must be great.

### id860078439

> Again like Xenophanes, Heraclitus believed that the sun was new every day (Aristotle, *Mete*. 2. 2355b13–14), and, like Anaximander, he thought the sun was constrained by a cosmic principle of reparation (KRS 226). The ephemeral theory of the sun is indeed in Heraclitus expanded into a doctrine of universal flux. Everything, he said, is in motion, and nothing stays still; the world is like a flowing stream. If we step into the same river twice, we cannot put our feet twice into the same water, since the water is not the same two moments together (KRS 214). That seems true enough, but on the face of it Heraclitus went too far when he said that we cannot even step twice into the same river (Plato, *Cra*. 402a). Taken literally, this seems false, unless we take the criterion of identity for a river to be the body of water it contains rather than the course it flows. Taken allegorically, it is presumably a claim that everything in the world is composed of constantly changing constituents: if this is what is meant, Aristotle said, the changes must be imperceptible ones (*Ph*. 8. 3. 253b9 ff.). Perhaps this is what is hinted at in Heraclitus’ aphorism that hidden harmony is better than manifest harmony—the harmony being the underlying rhythm of the universe in flux (KRS 207). Whatever Heraclitus meant by his dictum, it had a long history ahead of it in later Greek philosophy. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmpkt2qd1p0smzym60pc7y5)</span>

- [N] [[Heraclitus\|Heraclitus]]￼ doctrine of "universal flux"... "the world is like a stream. if we step into the same river twice we cannot put our feet twice into the same water."

### id860078748

> Heraclitus once said that the world was an ever-living fire: sea and earth are the ashes of this perpetual bonfire. Fire is like gold: you can exchange gold for all kinds of goods, and fire can turn into any of the elements (KRS 217–19). This fiery world is the only world there is, not made by gods or men, but governed throughout by Logos. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmpsqb0ykgsjxzcssd7shea)</span>

- [N] Fire as a paradigm of constant change, consuming, refueled. "Logos" was often interpreted as "Reason" from here on out.

### id860079018

> Humans fall into three classes, at various removes from the rational fire that governs the universe. A philosopher like Heraclitus is closest to the fiery Logos and receives most warmth from it; next, ordinary people when awake draw light from it when they use their own reasoning powers; finally, those who are asleep have the windows of their soul blocked up and keep contact with nature only through their breathing (S.E., *M*. 7. 129–30). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmpxwvq9em3tkdkndt1bktd)</span>

- [N] Three classes of humans in the rational fire 🔥 

### id860079263

> What Hegel most admired in Heraclitus was his insistence on the coincidence of opposites, such as that the universe is both divisible and indivisible, generated and ungenerated, mortal and immortal. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmq2bb84mej8m3245b7gvrs)</span>

- [N] Hegel liked Heraclitus for his insistence of opposites 

### id860133723

> Diogenes Laertius tells us that the sequence fire–air–water–earth is the road downward, and the sequence earth–water–air–fire is the road upward (D.L. 9. 9–11). These two roads can only be regarded as the same if they are seen as two stages on a continuous, everlasting, cosmic progress. Heraclitus did indeed believe that the cosmic fire went through stages of kindling and quenching (KRS 217). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnmtkntqy4w0e9w2ewyh5vnz)</span>

### id860542213

> Melissus expounded the philosophy of Parmenides’ poem in plain prose, arguing that the universe was unlimited, unchangeable, immovable, indivisible, and homogeneous. He was remembered for drawing two consequences from this monistic view: (1) pain was unreal, because it implied (impossibly) a deficiency of being; (2) there was no such thing as a vacuum, since it would have to be a piece of Unbeing. Local motion was therefore impossible, for the bodies that occupy space have no room to move into (KRS 534). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnq8h5pbdrj8xrs4gfwy94ht)</span>

### id860542767

> Thales had privileged water, Anaximenes air, Xenophanes earth, and Heraclitus fire. For Empedocles all four of these substances stood on equal terms as the fundamental ingredients, or ‘roots’ as he put it, of the universe. These roots had always existed, he maintained, but they mingle with each other in various proportions in such a way as to produce the familiar furniture of the world and also the denizens of the heavens. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnq8x719r8rk0vpqv3379fxj)</span>

- [N] 4 substances of Empedocles

### id860543143

> Empedocles assigns this role to Love and Strife: Love combines the elements, and Strife forces them apart. At one time the roots grow to be one out of many, at another time they split to be many out of one. These things, he said, never cease their continual interchange, now through love coming together into one, now carried apart from each other by Strife’s hatred <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnq92tk9mcgd16bn9qdk1hxj)</span>

- [N] Causes for development and intermingling of elements to make compounds of the world 

### id860543395

> Under the influence of Love the elements combine into a homogeneous, harmonious, and resplendent sphere, reminiscent of Parmenides’ universe. Under the influence of Strife the elements separate out, but when Love begins to regain the ground it had lost, all the different species of living beings appear (KRS 360). All compound beings, such as animals and birds and fish, are temporary creatures that come and go; only the elements are everlasting, and only the cosmic cycle goes on for ever. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnq94sv3dvw4jgvwmnegkstk)</span>

Some of them are concave and some convex, and some are like hooks and some are like eyes. In their ceaseless motion they bang into each other and join up with each other (KRS 583).

> The first is a rhetorical exercise defending Helen of Troy against those who slander her, arguing that she deserves no blame for running off with Paris and thus sparking off the Trojan war. ‘She did what she did either because of the whims of fortune, the decisions of the gods and the decrees of necessity, or because she was abducted by force, or persuaded by speech, or overwhelmed by love’ (DK 82 B11, 21–4). Gorgias goes through these alternatives in turn, arguing in each case that Helen should be held free from blame. No human can resist fate, and it is the abductor, not the abductee, who merits blame. Thus far, Gorgias has an easy task: but in order to show that Helen should not be blamed if she succumbed to persuasion, he has to engage in an unconvincing, though no doubt congenial, encomium on the powers of the spoken word: ‘it is a mighty overlord, insubstantial and imperceptible, but it can achieve divine effects’. In this case, too, it is the persuader, not the persuadee, who should be blamed. Finally, if Helen fell in love, she is blameless: for love is either a god who cannot be resisted or a mental illness which should excite our pity. This brief and witty piece is the ancestor of many a philosophical discussion of freedom and determinism, *force majeure*, incitement, and irresistible impulse. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnqas6parj3cysmthhmdtbxg)</span>

> The two procedures identified by Aristotle are, in Socrates’ method, closely related to each other. The inductive argument from particular instances to general truths is a contribution to the universal definition, even though the contribution in these dialogues is forever incomplete, never leading to an exception-proof definition. In the absence of the universal definition of a virtue, the general truths are applied to help settle difficult borderline cases of practice, and to evaluate preliminary hypotheses about the virtue’s properties. Thus, in the *Republic* case, the induction is used to show that a good ruler is one who benefits his subjects, and therefore justice is not (as one of the characters in the dialogue maintains) simply whatever is to the advantage of those in power. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnqebgpnmphkpa114hacesdj)</span>

> (5) *The Principle of Uniqueness*. Nothing but the Idea of F is really, truly, altogether F (*Phd*. 74d, *Rep*. 5. 479a–d).

Those among the soldiers best fitted to rule are selected by competition to form the upper class, called guardians; the remaining soldiers are described as auxiliaries, and the rest of the citizens belong to the class of farmers and artisans (2. 374d–376e). How are the working classes to be brought to accept the authority of the ruling classes? A myth must be propagated, a ‘noble falsehood’, to the effect that members of the three classes have different metals in their soul: gold, silver, and bronze respectively. Citizens in general are to remain in the class in which they were born, but Socrates allows a limited amount of social mobility (3. 414c–415c).
> The rulers and auxiliaries are to receive an elaborate education in literature (based on a bowdlerized Homer), music (provided it is martial and edifying), and gymnastics (undertaken by both sexes in common) (2. 376e–3. 403b). Women as well as men are to be guardians and auxiliaries, but this involves severe restraints no less than privileges. Members of the upper classes are not allowed to marry; women are to be held in common and all sexual intercourse is to be public. Procreation is to be strictly regulated on eugenic grounds. Children are not to be allowed contact with their parents, but will be brought up in public creches. Guardians and auxiliaries may not own property or touch money; they will be given, free of charge, adequate but modest provisions, and they will live in common like soldiers in a camp (5. 451d–471c). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsnd9ejbt9x82ex44kgcygy)</span>

Ordinary citizens will take part in the administration of the laws by sitting on enormous juries. Various appointments are made by lot, so as to ensure wide political participation. Private property is allowed, subject to a highly progressive wealth tax (5. 744b). Marriage, far from being abolished, is imposed by law, and bachelors over 35 have to pay severe annual fines (6. 774b). Finally, legislators must realize that even the best laws are constantly in need of reform (6. 769d).

Supreme power in the state rests with a Nocturnal Council, which includes the wisest and most highly qualified officials, specially trained in mathematics, astronomy, theology, and law (though not, like the guardians of the Republic, metaphysics). Private citizens are not allowed to possess gold or silver coins, and the sale of houses is strictly forbidden (5. 740c, 742a). Severe censorship is imposed on both texts and music, and poets must be licensed (7. 801d–2a). Female sex police, with right of entry to households, oversee procreation and enforce eugenic standards (6. 784a–b). In divorce courts there must be as many women judges as men (9. 930a). Women are to join men at the communal meals, and they are to receive military training, and provide a home defence force (7. 814a). Education is of great importance for all classes, and is to be supervised by a powerful Minister of Education reporting direct to the Nocturnal Council (6. 765d). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsnvmym6yy5p8thcsvmv49a)</span>

### id860964429

> There are three kinds of sciences, Aristotle tells us in the *Metaphysics (E* 1. 1025b25): productive, practical, and theoretical sciences. Productive sciences are, naturally enough, sciences that have a product. They include engineering and architecture, with products like bridges and houses, but also disciplines such as strategy and rhetoric, where the product is something less concrete, such as victory on the battlefield or in the courts. Practical sciences are ones that guide behaviour, most notably ethics and politics. Theoretical sciences are those that have no product and no practical goal, but in which information and understanding is sought for its own sake. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsw7gs0ymvzx8326t75szpv)</span>

### id860964514

> There are three theoretical sciences: physics, mathematics, and theology *(Metaph. E* 1. 1026a19). In this trilogy only mathematics is what it seems to be. ‘Physics’ means natural philosophy or the study of nature *(physis)*. It is a much broader study than physics as understood nowadays, including chemistry and meteorology and even biology and psychology. ‘Theology’ is, for Aristotle, the study of entities above and superior to human beings, that is to say, the heavenly bodies as well as whatever divinities may inhabit the starry skies. His writings on this topic resemble a textbook of astronomy more than they resemble any discourse on natural religion. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsw8pn1cpvf5qbtjwtrgd97)</span>

> Material objects are imperfect copies of the truly real Ideas; artistic representations of material objects are therefore at two removes from reality, being imitations of imitations (597e). Drama corrupts by appealing to the lower parts of our nature, encouraging us to indulge in weeping and laughter (605d–6c).

> From what has been said it is clear that the poet’s job is to describe not something that has actually happened, but something that might well happen, that is to say something that is possible because it is necessary or likely. The difference between a historian and a poet is not a matter of prose v. verse—you might turn Herodotus into metre and it would still be history. It is rather in this matter of writing what happens rather than what might happen. For this reason poetry is more philosophical and more important than history; for poetry tells us of the universal, history tells us only of the particular.

> The government, that is to say the supreme authority in a state, must be in the hands of one, or of a few, or of the many. The rightful true forms of government, therefore, are ones where the one, or the few, or the many, govern with a view to the common interest; governments that rule with a view to the private interest, whether of the one, or the few, or the many, are perversions. Those who belong to a state, if they are truly to be called citizens, must share in its benefits. Government by a single person, if it aims at the common interest, we are accustomed to call ‘monarchy’; similar government by a minority we call ‘aristocracy’, either because the rulers are the best men, or because it aims at the best interests of the state and the community. When it is the majority that governs in the common interest we call it a ‘polity’, using a word which is also a generic term for a constitution . . . Of each of these forms of government there exists a perversion. The perversion of monarchy is tyranny; that of aristocracy is oligarchy; that of polity is democracy. For tyranny is a monarchy exercised solely for the benefit of the monarch, oligarchy has in view only the interests of the wealthy, and democracy the interests only of the poorer classes. None of these aims at the common good of all. (3. 6. 1279a26–b10) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsxsta38zd76gvntreaeckh)</span>

Each element had its natural place in an ordered cosmos, and each element had an innate tendency to move towards this natural place. Thus, earthy solids naturally fell, while fire, unless prevented, rose ever higher. Each such motion was natural to its element; other motions were possible, but were ‘violent’. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsy7skcshyvygdwqzzs31qg)</span>

> The earth was in the centre of the universe: around it a succession of concentric crystalline spheres carried the moon, the sun, and the planets in their journeys around the visible sky. The heavenly bodies were not compounds of the four terrestrial elements, but were made of a superior fifth element or quintessence. They had souls as well as bodies: living supernatural intellects, guiding their travels through the cosmos. These intellects were movers which were themselves in motion, and behind them, Aristotle argued, there must be a source of movement not itself in motion. The only way in which an unchanging, eternal mover could cause motion in other beings was by attracting them as an object of love, an attraction which they express by their perfect circular motion. It is thus that Dante, in the final lines of his *Paradiso*, finds his own will, like a smoothly rotating wheel, caught up in the love that moves the sun and all the other stars. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnsyb7wwbkdb5n63dcqs0wxa)</span>

> The aim of Epicurus’ philosophy is to make happiness possible by removing the fear of death, which is the greatest obstacle to tranquillity. Men struggle for wealth and power so as to postpone death; they throw themselves into frenzied activity so that they can forget its inevitability. It is religion that causes us to fear death, by holding out the prospect of suffering after death. But this is an illusion. The terrors held out by religion are fairy tales, which we must give up in favour of a scientific account of the world. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnszm8mq75e7ynyka7rh1peg)</span>

> Nothing comes into being from nothing: the basic units of the world are everlasting, unchanging, indivisible units or atoms. These, infinite in number, move about in the void, which is empty and infinite space: if there were no void, movement would be impossible. This motion had no beginning, and initially all atoms move downwards at constant and equal speed. From time to time, however, they swerve and collide, and it is from the collision of atoms that everything in heaven and earth has come into being. The swerve of the atoms allows scope for human freedom, even though their motions are blind and purposeless. Atoms have no properties other than shape, weight, and size. The properties of perceptible bodies are not illusions, but they are supervenient on the basic properties of atoms. There is an infinite number of worlds, some like and some unlike our own (Letter to Herodotus, D.L. 10. 38–45). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnszp4txksv2dstvs8nfq9bz)</span>

There is one kind of pleasure that is given by the satisfaction of our desires for food, drink, and sex, but it is an inferior kind of pleasure, because it is bound up with pain. The desire these pleasures satisfy is itself painful, and its satisfaction leads to a renewal of desire.

All this happens in accordance with a system of laws which may be called ‘fate’ (because the laws admit of no exception), or ‘providence’ (because the laws were laid down by God for beneficent purposes).

> Seneca was a materialist, accepting the Stoic doctrine that the human mind was a material part of a material divine world-soul (Ep. 66. 12). But he often writes about the relation between soul and body in a manner that is distinctly otherworldly. ‘The human heart is never more divine than when it meditates on its own mortality, and realises that a human being is born in order to give up life, and that this body is not a home but a short-term hostelry which one must leave as soon as one sees one is becoming a burden on one’s host’ (120. 14). Seneca recognizes the difficulty of the Stoic path to virtue. He distinguishes between three stages in moral progress. There are those who have given up some vices but not all—they are without avarice, but not without anger; without lust but not without ambition; and so on. Then there are those who have given up all passions but are not yet safe from relapse. The third class, the closest approximation to wisdom, consists of those who are beyond relapsing, but have not yet acquired secure self-confidence in their virtue (Ep. 75. 8–14). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnt23x1srap3q8z74t33hh8g)</span>

The One is, in a mysterious way, identical with the Platonic Idea of the Good: it is the basis of all being and the standard of all value, but it is itself beyond being and beyond goodness. Below this supreme and ineffable summit, the next places are occupied by Mind (the locus of Ideas) and Soul, which is the creator of time and space. Soul looks upward to Mind, but downward to Nature, which in turn creates the physical world. At the lowest level of all is bare matter, the outermost limit of reality.

Propositions, on Diodorus’ definitions, change not only their truth-values but also their modalities. ‘The Persian Empire has been destroyed’ was untrue but possible when Socrates was alive; after Alexander’s victories it was true and necessary (LS 38E).

	1.	Premise 1: The Past is Fixed – Anything that has happened is unchangeable.
	2.	Premise 2: The Impossible Cannot Follow from the Possible – If something is possible, it must not lead to an impossible conclusion.
	3.	Premise 3: What is Possible Must Either Be True or Will Be True – If something is truly possible, then at some point, it either has happened, is happening, or will happen.
	- Conclusion: Since only what will actually happen can be possible, the argument leads to determinism—only one future is possible, and everything else is impossible. This rejects the idea of contingency and open possibilities.

> Philo’s major contribution to logic was his definition of the conditional. ‘If *p*, then q’, he said, was false in the case in which *p* was true and *q* false, and true in the three other possible cases. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnwczyv6ab5smxe030wzzmer)</span>

- [N] Philo of Megara’s definition of the conditional closely resembles what modern logic calls material implication—a truth-functional way of evaluating “if-then” statements. Let’s break this down and illustrate it with examples:
	1. Truth Conditions of the Conditional (If P, then Q)
	According to Philo, the conditional “If P, then Q” is:
		•	False only when P is true and Q is false.
		•	True in all other cases (when P is false, or when P and Q are both true).
	Example 1: “If it is raining, then the ground is wet.”
		•	If it is raining (P is true) and the ground is not wet (Q is false), the statement is false.
		•	In all other cases—if it’s not raining or if the ground is wet—the statement is true.
	2. Truth is Based Only on Truth-Values, Not Meaning
	Philo’s logic doesn’t care about the meaning or connection between P and Q—only their truth-values.
	Example 2: “If it is night, it is day.”
		•	This sounds incorrect in everyday reasoning, but in Philo’s system:
		•	If it is daytime (Q is true), the statement is true no matter what P says.
		•	If it is night (P is true) and not day (Q is false), then the statement is false.
	Similarly, an odd statement like:
	“If there are no atoms, there are atoms.”
		•	If atomic theory is true (meaning “there are atoms” is always true), then the conditional is always true—even though it sounds paradoxical.
	3. Changeable Truth-Values & Logical Problems
	Philo’s conditionals depend on truth-values at the time they are evaluated. This causes issues with certain logical laws.
	Example 3: “If I am sitting, then I am sitting.”
		•	Suppose I am sitting at the start (P is true).
		•	But if I stand up before the statement is fully considered, then Q (I am sitting) is false.
		•	This makes the statement false, even though it seems like it should always be true!
	- Summary
		•	Philo defined if-then statements only by truth-values, ignoring the actual meaning or logical connection between P and Q.
		•	His system resembles modern material implication but differs because it allows truth-values to change over time.
		•	This leads to strange results, like a logically obvious statement (“If I am sitting, I am sitting”) becoming false if the truth-values change mid-evaluation.

It cannot come from the eyes, since they cannot see sounds; it cannot come from the ears, since they cannot hear colours.

Beautiful things other than the Idea of Beauty, for instance, are beautiful only at one time and not another, or beautiful only in one part and not in another.

If there is anything at the opposite pole from an Idea, something that utterly *is not*, that is totally unknowable. But most things that are F are partly F and partly not F, F in one respect and not in another. They are set in between what is utterly F and what is utterly not F.

> But in the *Republic* the difference between knowledge and belief is a difference between objects: between *what* is known and *what* is thought of. This point is made quite explicitly. Knowledge and thought, Plato says, are *powers (dynameis)*, just as sight and hearing are powers. Powers do not have colours or shapes by which we can tell one from another. ‘In the case of a power I look only at what it is concerned with and what it does to it, and by reference to that I call each the power it is’ (477d). Sight is a power to discriminate colour, and hearing a power to discriminate sound: it is the difference between the objects, colour and sound, that distinguishes these two powers from each other. Similarly, Plato proposes, the difference between knowledge and belief is to be determined by noting the differences between the two kinds of object with which they deal (478b6 ff.). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnyb3k1jq0daggjgey9vangk)</span>

But there is also another kind of knowledge, typical of the mathematician, to which Plato gives the name *dianoia* (509c5 ff.). The abstract objects of the mathematician share with the Ideas the characteristic of eternity and unchangeability: they belong to the world of being, not of becoming. But they also share a characteristic with ordinary terrestrial objects, namely they are multiple and not single. The geometer’s circles, unlike the Ideal Circle, can intersect with each other; and the arithmetician’s twos, unlike the one and only Idea of Two, can be added to each other to make four (cf. 525c–526a). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnyb9f2s7qhtgs3q4xnm59kb)</span>

> Aristotle introduces three terms to indicate different relationships between quantified items: they may be successive *(ephexes)*, adjacent *(hama)*, or continuous *(syneches)*. Two items are successive if between them there is nothing of the same kind as themselves. Thus, two islands in an archipelago are successive if there is only sea between them; two days are successive if there is no day, but only night, between them. Two items are adjacent, Aristotle says, if they have two boundaries in contact with each other, and they are continuous if there is only a single common boundary between them (231a18–25). He uses these definitions to base an argument that a continuum cannot be composed of indivisible atoms. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnyz15rky2p1xbhjrxe19xvw)</span>

### id861700979

> A line, for instance, cannot be composed of points that lack magnitude. Since a point has no parts, it cannot have a boundary distinct from itself: two points therefore cannot be either adjacent or continuous. If you say that the boundary of a point is identical with the point itself, then two points that were continuous would be one and the same point. Nor can points be successive to each other: between any two points on a continuous line we can always find other points on the same line (231a29–b15). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnyz9h8b7samv11p9kvnkan9)</span>

- [N] Simplified: A line can't be made up of points that don't have size. A point is so small that it doesn't have any parts, so it doesn't have a clear edge that makes it different from itself. Because of this, two points can't be next to each other or connected. If you think of a point's edge as being the same as the point, then if two points were connected, they would actually be the same point. Also, points can't come one after another; between any two points on a line, you can always find more points.

### id861701059

> Similar reasoning, Aristotle says, applies to spatial magnitude, to time, and to motion: all three are continua of the same kind. Time cannot be composed of indivisible moments, because between any two moments there is always a period of time; and an atom of motion would in fact have to be a moment of rest. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnyzb986q5yafj82tnq3dcjk)</span>

Not that time is identical with motion: motions are motions of particular things, and different kinds of changes are motions of different kinds, but time is universal and uniform. Motions, again, may be faster or slower; not so time. Indeed it is by the time they take that the speed of motions is determined (4. 10. 218b9; 14. 223b4).

### id861727869

> Aristotle distinguishes four types of cause, or explanation. First, he says, there is that of which and out of which a thing is made, such as the bronze of a statue and the letters of a syllable. This is called the material cause. Secondly, he says, there is the form and pattern of a thing, which may be expressed in its definition: his example is that the proportion of the length of two strings in a lyre is the cause of one note being an octave away from the other. The third type of cause is the origin of a change or state of rest in something; Aristotle’s followers often called it the ‘efficient cause’. Aristotle gives as examples a person reaching a decision, a father who begets a child, a sculptor carving a statue, a doctor healing a patient, and in general anyone who makes a thing or changes a thing. The fourth and last type of cause is the end or goal, that for the sake of which something is done; it is the type of explanation we give if someone asks us why we are taking a walk, and we reply ‘In order to keep healthy’. This last kind of cause became known as the ‘final cause’. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnz2vc3f11rpt2ykxp7psn01)</span>

> The Stoics’ standard analysis of causation was of the following form: A brings it about that B is F. A, the cause, must be a body, and so must B; but the effect, B’s being F, is not a body but an abstract entity, a *lekton*. This is explained by Sextus:
> The Stoics say that every cause is a body that becomes for another body a cause of something non-bodily. For instance a scalpel, which is a body, becomes for the flesh, another body, a cause of the non-bodily predicate *being cut*. Again a fire, which is a body, becomes for the wood, another body, a cause of the non-bodily predicate *being burnt. (M*. 9. 211)
> While A and B are both material entities, the Stoics used the term ‘matter’ specially to refer to B, the passive element in causation (Seneca, Ep. 65. 2 LS 55E).
