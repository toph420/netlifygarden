# There Is No Antimemetics Division

> **Addendum A**:
> > Hey, if this thing really is an "anti-meme", why doesn't the fact that it's an "anti-meme" get wiped? We must be wrong about that somehow. Wait a minute, what if we were to keep notes about what it isn't? Would we remember those? *Bartholomew Hughes, NSA* <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6bdhhbknj372fd8tfawq73p)</span>

> It appears to be possible to remember what SCP-055 is not (negations of fact), and to repeatedly deduce its existence from these memories. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6bdr04n5e7cc41f80xfybhj)</span>

> *User's Guide To Chemical Mnestics*:
> > The Class-X mnestic drug is a failed eternal youth serum. X rejuvenates both mind and body by up to â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ years, but its effects are temporary, wearing off in a matter of hours. Furthermore, as the drug wears off, the suppressed time reasserts itself all at once, causing a harmful "whiplash" effect on the subject's physiology. X can rejuvenate an individual safely by up to thirty days, but with stronger doses the whiplash effect becomes dangerous, and past a threshold of 16-18 months it is fatal in all known subjects.
> > 
> > X's restorative effect on the human memory is essentially a side-effect of all of this. However, this side-effect is so useful that it has become the drug's main practical purpose. The Antimemetics Division uses small doses of X to temporarily sharpen or restore memories from the recent past. This aids Foundation operatives in the accurate recall of incidents involving memory-corrupting entities. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6dv88m6tnm7m49vrtj4kjpy)</span>

> "We got looped. It was textbook. We built the unthinkable bomb and test-detonated it... and it worked perfectly. The bomb destroyed itself, and erased its own successful detonation, and flattened all the knowledge which had gone together to build it. We forgot that we had ever built the bomb at all, and started over. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6dvg9drthw6yp43w78nt359)</span>

> Don't you get it? The whole division is looped! We start the division, we run headlong into this thing, and either it eats us, or we wipe ourselves out in self-preservation. The idea of antimemes is as old as forgetfulness itself. Humans have been looping through this problem over and over again since long before the Forties. Maybe for centuries!" <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6dvyc42j9zzkac04h9myw5b)</span>

> The gap in her memory is about thirteen hours.
> Then she adds her report to the extensive, complex map of Missing Time which the whole division maintains collectively. It is a map of holes, and the map is becoming large enough that very faint patterns are gradually forming. The outline of an enemy is becoming visible, or perhaps a group of enemies. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6dw98h0bxkp8de2sy0vgar6)</span>

> If something can cross over from conceptual space into reality, taking physical form, then something can cross in the opposite direction. It must be possible to take a physical entity, mechanically extract the *idea which it embodies*, amplify that idea and broadcast it up into conceptual space. A bigger idea. A better idea, one designed specifically to fight SCP-3125.

> SCP-2256 was the largest species to have lived on Earth. Resembling spindly, vertically elongated giraffes or brachiosauruses, adults of the species grew to over 1,000 metres in height. They weighed no more than 4 tonnes, with most of their mass being "camouflaged" by a very similar adaptation. With their broad, dish-shaped feet, they were able to walk directly on the surface of the ocean without sinking. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6gjgj3rn22b0gfkjmw80vj2)</span>
