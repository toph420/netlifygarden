# The Dawn of Everything

## Thoughts

## Highlights

### id829633497

> ‘Good’ and ‘evil’ are purely human concepts. It would never occur to anyone to argue about whether a fish, or a tree, were good or evil, because ‘good’ and ‘evil’ are concepts humans made up in order to compare ourselves with one another. It follows that arguing about whether humans are fundamentally good or evil makes about as much sense as arguing about whether humans are fundamentally fat or thin. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg302cyzt5m2s7kf3xf6awsb)</span>

### id829633513

> Hobbes’s *Leviathan*, published in 1651, is in many ways the founding text of modern political theory. It held that, humans being the selfish creatures they are, life in an original State of Nature was in no sense innocent; it must instead have been ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’ – basically, a state of war, with everybody fighting against everybody else. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg3031vhm7ma1ttn0zhe791v)</span>

### id829633612

> Agriculture, in turn, did not mean the inception of private property, nor did it mark an irreversible step towards inequality. In fact, many of the first farming communities were relatively free of ranks and hierarchies. And far from setting class differences in stone, a surprising number of the world’s earliest cities were organized on robustly egalitarian lines, with no need for authoritarian rulers, ambitious warrior-politicians, or even bossy administrators. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg303vpnsgx76y5rfp6bhhrq)</span>

### id829633678

> The political implications of the Hobbesian model need little elaboration. It is a foundational assumption of our economic system that humans are at base somewhat nasty and selfish creatures, basing their decisions on cynical, egoistic calculation rather than altruism or co-operation; in which case, the best we can hope for are more sophisticated internal and external controls on our supposedly innate drive towards accumulation and self-aggrandizement. Rousseau’s story about how humankind descended into inequality from an original state of egalitarian innocence seems more optimistic (at least there was somewhere better to fall from), but nowadays it’s mostly deployed to convince us that while the system we live under might be unjust, the most we can realistically aim for is a bit of modest tinkering. The term ‘inequality’ is itself very telling in this regard. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30549502qeswfyvnk82n8z)</span>

> It’s possible to imagine overthrowing capitalism or breaking the power of the state, but it’s not clear what eliminating inequality would even mean. (Which kind of inequality? Wealth? Opportunity? Exactly how equal would people have to be in order for us to be able to say we’ve ‘eliminated inequality’?) The term ‘inequality’ is a way of framing social problems appropriate to an age of technocratic reformers, who assume from the outset that no real vision of social transformation is even on the table. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30734fdjhmfs8dw5wewfnh)</span>

### id829634332

> for instance, that some manage to turn their wealth into power over others; or that other people end up being told their needs are not important, and their lives have no intrinsic worth. The last, we are supposed to believe, is just the inevitable effect of inequality; and inequality, the inevitable result of living in any large, complex, urban, technologically sophisticated society. Presumably it will always be with us. It’s just a matter of degree. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg308prrjkqyewf9jge24qkj)</span>

### id829634343

> The ultimate effect of all these stories about an original state of innocence and equality, like the use of the term ‘inequality’ itself, is to make wistful pessimism about the human condition seem like common sense: the natural result of viewing ourselves through history’s broad lens. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg309222mzkyzekpr857htnm)</span>

### id829634395

> The ultimate question of human history, as we’ll see, is not our equal access to material resources (land, calories, means of production), much though these things are obviously important, but our equal capacity to contribute to decisions about how to live together. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg309vdnam8nt71c7xmak19r)</span>

### id829634519

> We are projects of collective self-creation. What if we approached human history that way? What if we treat people, from the beginning, as imaginative, intelligent, playful creatures who deserve to be understood as such? What if, instead of telling a story about how our species fell from some idyllic state of equality, we ask how we came to be trapped in such tight conceptual shackles that we can no longer even imagine the possibility of reinventing ourselves? <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30aapdrdmvtmf45b9wgsem)</span>

> As Diamond patiently explains to us:
> > Large populations can’t function without leaders who make the decisions, executives who carry out the decisions, and bureaucrats who administer the decisions and laws. Alas for all of you readers who are anarchists and dream of living without any state government, those are the reasons why your dream is unrealistic: you’ll have to find some tiny band or tribe willing to accept you, where no one is a stranger, and where kings, presidents, and bureaucrats are unnecessary.[5](#chapter001_en_5) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30c588nray16xm4md7v5m9)</span>

### id829634773

> what Rousseau presented was more of a parable, by way of an attempt to explore a fundamental paradox of human politics: how is it that our innate drive for freedom somehow leads us, time and again, on a ‘spontaneous march to inequality’?[8](#chapter001_en_8)
> Describing how the invention of farming first leads to private property, and property to the need for civil government to protect it, this is how Rousseau puts things: ‘All ran towards their chains, believing that they were securing their liberty; for although they had reason enough to discern the advantages of a civil order, they did not have experience enough to foresee the dangers.’[9](#chapter001_en_9) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30ebmq9kk6peatvrswmn35)</span>

### id829634836

> Yes, a little over 5,000 years ago someone walking through the Alps left the world of the living with an arrow in his side; but there’s no particular reason to treat Ötzi as a poster child for humanity in its original condition, other than, perhaps, Ötzi suiting Pinker’s argument. But if all we’re doing is cherry-picking, we could just as easily have chosen the much earlier burial known to archaeologists as Romito 2 (after the Calabrian rock-shelter where it was found). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30frh5pzw97rh9em3j05ek)</span>

- [N] Cherry picking these stories results in bad hypotheses. Sure you can use the guy with the arrow in his side to say humans were all violent, but you can also use the dwarf, that in spite of being unable to work or provide was well taken care of... now what? A whole different story emerges

### id829634902

> the ‘Hobbesian trap’, whereby individuals in tribal societies find themselves caught in repetitive cycles of raiding and warfare, living fraught and precarious lives, always just a few steps away from violent death on the tip of a sharp weapon or at the end of a vengeful club. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30hrek29yv0zdgxfvkqhp1)</span>

- [N] The Hobbesian trap

### id829634947

> The word ‘democracy’ might have been invented in Europe (barely, since Greece at the time was much closer culturally to North Africa and the Middle East than it was to, say, England), but it’s almost impossible to find a single European author before the nineteenth century who suggested it would be anything other than a terrible form of government.[23](#chapter001_en_23) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30jqrt9a9gp05h0pz48mfz)</span>

### id829634983

> Hobbes’s position tends to be favoured by those on the right of the political spectrum, and Rousseau’s by those leaning left. Pinker positions himself as a rational centrist, condemning what he considers to be the extremists on either side. But why then insist that all significant forms of human progress before the twentieth century can be attributed only to that one group of humans who used to refer to themselves as ‘the white race’ (and now, generally, call themselves by its more accepted synonym, ‘Western civilization’)? There is simply no reason to make this move. It would be just as easy (actually, rather easier) to identify things that can be interpreted as the first stirrings of rationalism, legality, deliberative democracy and so forth all over the world, and only then tell the story of how they coalesced into the current global system.[24](#chapter001_en_24) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30kj64c2t2k8649m22j5xm)</span>

### id829635025

> Pinker assures us, there is every reason to be optimistic, indeed happy, about the overall path our species has taken. True, he does concede there is scope for some serious tinkering in areas like poverty reduction, income inequality or indeed peace and security; but on balance – and relative to the number of people living on earth today – what we have now is a spectacular improvement on anything our species accomplished in its history so far (unless you’re Black, or live in Syria, for example). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30mbnn01m3n5e4dtdf8kec)</span>

- [N] Pinker the centrist is a classic grifter


### id829635109

> Let us consider the case of Helena Valero, a Brazilian woman born into a family of Spanish descent, whom Pinker mentions as a ‘white girl’ abducted by Yanomami in 1932 while travelling with her parents along the remote Rio Dimití.
> For two decades, Valero lived with a series of Yanomami families, marrying twice, and eventually achieving a position of some importance in her community. Pinker briefly cites the account Valero later gave of her own life, where she describes the brutality of a Yanomami raid.[26](#chapter001_en_26) What he neglects to mention is that in 1956 she abandoned the Yanomami to seek her natal family and live again in ‘Western civilization,’ only to find herself in a state of occasional hunger and constant dejection and loneliness. After a while, given the ability to make a fully informed decision, Helena Valero decided she preferred life among the Yanomami, and returned to live with them.[27](#chapter001_en_27) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30n72nc716q6xn1z15srxh)</span>

> Benjamin Franklin to a friend:
> > When an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them there is no persuading him ever to return, and that this is not natural merely as Indians, but as men, is plain from this, that when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoner young by the Indians, and lived awhile among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them. One instance I remember to have heard, where the person was to be brought home to possess a good Estate; but finding some care necessary to keep it together, he relinquished it to a younger brother, reserving to himself nothing but a gun and match-Coat, with which he took his way again to the Wilderness.[30](#chapter001_en_30) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30qk0k52prjge3xxa3cq1b)</span>

- [N] [[Benjamin Franklin\|Benjamin Franklin]] to a friend, tells the story of a man that left his estate and headed back to the woods with a coat and his gun.

### id829636119

> Western propagandists speak endlessly about equality of opportunity; these seem to have been societies where it actually existed. By far the most common reasons, however, had to do with the intensity of social bonds they experienced in Native American communities: qualities of mutual care, love and above all happiness, which they found impossible to replicate once back in European settings. ‘Security’ takes many forms. There is the security of knowing one has a statistically smaller chance of getting shot with an arrow. And then there’s the security of knowing that there are people in the world who will care deeply if one is. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30rh6x0td7w9t9z3v8bhw2)</span>

### id829636205

> One of the most pernicious aspects of standard world-historical narratives is precisely that they dry everything up, reduce people to cardboard stereotypes, simplify the issues (are we inherently selfish and violent, or innately kind and co-operative?) in ways that themselves undermine, possibly even destroy, our sense of human possibility. ‘Noble’ savages are, ultimately, just as boring as savage ones; more to the point, neither actually exist. Helena Valero was herself adamant on this point. The Yanomami were not devils, she insisted, neither were they angels. They were human, like the rest of us. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30sfqj8c88zxrpnhmg3ksg)</span>

### id829636343

> The founding text of twentieth-century ethnography, Bronisław Malinowski’s 1922 *Argonauts of the Western Pacific*, describes how in the ‘kula chain’ of the Massim Islands off Papua New Guinea, men would undertake daring expeditions across dangerous seas in outrigger canoes, just in order to exchange precious heirloom arm-shells and necklaces for each other (each of the most important ones has its own name, and history of former owners) – only to hold it briefly, then pass it on again to a different expedition from another island. Heirloom treasures circle the island chain eternally, crossing hundreds of miles of ocean, arm-shells and necklaces in opposite directions. To an outsider, it seems senseless. To the men of the Massim it was the ultimate adventure, and nothing could be more important than to spread one’s name, in this fashion, to places one had never seen. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30vvjeg8g20syzf1qtxc8c)</span>

- [N] Interesting example of how just because lavish items were found on opposite ends of the world, it does not mean a market existed. [[Cards/300 - Social Sciences/Capitalism\|Capitalism]] is not nature, one could argue it is true, but the definition of market breaks here.

### id829636396

> Let’s list just a few, all drawn from North American material, to give the reader a taste of what might really be going on when people speak of ‘long-distance interaction spheres’ in the human past:
> 1.  **Dreams or vision quests**: among Iroquoian-speaking peoples in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was considered extremely important literally to realize one’s dreams. Many European observers marvelled at how Indians would be willing to travel for days to bring back some object, trophy, crystal or even an animal like a dog that they had dreamed of acquiring. Anyone who dreamed about a neighbour or relative’s possession (a kettle, ornament, mask and so on) could normally demand it; as a result, such objects would often gradually travel some way from town to town. On the Great Plains, decisions to travel long distances in search of rare or exotic items could form part of vision quests.[34](#chapter001_en_34)
> 2.  **Travelling healers and entertainers**: in 1528, when a shipwrecked Spaniard named Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca made his way from Florida across what is now Texas to Mexico, he found he could pass easily between villages (even villages at war with one another) by offering his services as a magician and curer. Curers in much of North America were also entertainers, and would often develop significant entourages; those who felt their lives had been saved by the performance would, typically, offer up all their material possessions to be divided among the troupe.[35](#chapter001_en_35) By such means, precious objects could easily travel very long distances.
> 3.  **Women’s gambling**: women in many indigenous North American societies were inveterate gamblers; the women of adjacent villages would often meet to play dice or a game played with a bowl and plum stone, and would typically bet their shell beads or other objects of personal adornment as the stakes. One archaeologist versed in the ethnographic literature, Warren DeBoer, estimates that many of the shells and other exotica discovered in sites halfway across the continent had got there by being endlessly wagered, and lost, in inter-village games of this sort, over very long periods of time.[36](#chapter001_en_36) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30xqmqfz8xyn93w8dz4t03)</span>

### id829636405

> When we simply guess as to what humans in other times and places might be up to, we almost invariably make guesses that are far less interesting, far less quirky – in a word, far less human than what was likely going on. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg30xydd2gzk5r2r4m9qqcga)</span>

- [N] Historians of the past have acted ingenuously and lazy, stripping what makes humans so interesting from this experience.
