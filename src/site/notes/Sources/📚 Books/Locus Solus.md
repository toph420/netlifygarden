> [!summary]+
> **summary**:: 
Locus Solus is a surreal and fantastical novel that takes the reader on a tour of an estate where the eccentric scientist Canterel showcases his bizarre inventions and experiments. These include resurrected historical figures reliving their key memories, a diamond tank filled with strange creatures, and other fantastical contraptions, each with its own elaborate and absurd backstory. The novel is characterized by its dreamlike imagery, intricate descriptions, and playful exploration of science, art, and the boundaries of reality.


> [!Ava]- AI Highlight Analysis
> 
*Locus Solus* by Raymond Roussel is a journey into the bizarre and fantastical, centered around the estate of the eccentric scientist Canterel and his outlandish inventions. The novel explores themes of memory, artificial life, and the boundaries between science and art, all wrapped in a distinctly surreal package. Canterel's experiments often involve blurring the lines between life and death, such as his method of resurrecting corpses to relive their past memories: "At last, after a great deal of trial and error...the professor prepared on the one hand vitalium and on the other resurrectine... As a consequence of a curious awakening of memory, the latter would at once reproduce, with strict exactitude, every slightest action performed by him during certain outstanding minutes of his life". This quote encapsulates the novel's fascination with reanimation and the manipulation of memory.
>
> The theme of artificiality extends beyond just reanimated corpses. Canterel's estate is filled with strange contraptions, like the "dazzling tank on the sunniest spot in his estate...which Canterel named aqua-micans," showcasing a blend of science and whimsical artistry. This is further exemplified by the "Cartesian divers" and "hippocampi" within the tank, creating a crazy imagery.
> 
> Constraints and the cyclical nature of existence also emerge as themes. The passage about Gérard, who uses a meticulous process to mark off the days of his confinement, highlights how individuals grapple with limitations and find ways to measure their existence within those constraints: "As fifty days, counting the present one, still stood between him and the unalterable date of his death...".
> 
> Ultimately, *Locus Solus* challenges the reader to question the nature of reality, memory, and the possibilities of science and art. Through Canterel's eccentric inventions and the dreamlike atmosphere of his estate, Roussel crafts a world where the boundaries of what is possible are constantly being pushed.


## Thoughts

> An entirely unique experience; like a leisurely, sometimes disturbing, stroll through a museum of magic, each exhibit offering a layered history. Loved it, some "magic" was more fun than others, but all in all I had a blast. Hopefully one day I can visit Locus Solus ;)

> At last, after a great deal of trial and error and long experimenting with corpses submitted in time to the required degree of cold, the professor prepared on the one hand vitalium and on the other resurrectine. The latter was a reddish substance based on erythrite, which, when injected as a liquid into the skull of some defunct person through a laterally pierced opening, solidified of its own accord around the brain, encompassing it on all sides. It was then only necessary to put some point of the internal envelope thus created into contact with vitalium (a brown metal easily introduced into the injection hole in the form of a short rod) for the two new substances, each of them inactive without the other, to release a powerful current of electricity at that moment, which penetrated the brain and overcame its cadaveric rigidity, endowing the subject with an impressive artificial life. As a consequence of a curious awakening of memory, the latter would at once reproduce, with strict exactitude, every slightest action performed by him during certain outstanding minutes of his life; then, without any break, he would indefinitely repeat the same unvarying series of deeds and gestures which he had chosen once and for all. The illusion of life was absolute: mobility of expression, the continual working of the lungs, speech, various actions, walking — nothing was missing. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkcf9njy3kvmhxd1vbjhjf74)</span>

> As fifty days, counting the present one, still stood between him and the unalterable date of his death, Gérard looked to see if there was any page that listed precisely this number of words. At the top of the fifteenth page, which answered his requirement he employed his skillful process to write the words “Cell Days” — the first word being warranted by the harshness of his confinement. Two further words, “Credit” and “Debit” were written to serve as titles, one the right way round above the first column, and the other back to front below the second. Still using the thorn, the water and the gold dust, he was to strike out each day, starting from the beginning of the page one of the fifty names henceforth destined to represent the last fifty days of his solitary confinement. Gérard would see his credit, consisting of the number of days accomplished, grow at the same time as his debit, the total of days yet to do, diminished. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkcgkc3w1x3vz12n8tkb7592)</span>
