### id751378580

> Life everywhere is life, life is in ourselves and not in the external. There will be people near me, and to be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed, and not to falter—this is what life is, herein lies its task. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3vjd3c2zetxj5ftyetvj7cm)</span>

### id751381093

> what he sought in the voicing of his characters was the singular expression of the person. He delighted in the richness of spoken language, its playfulness, its happy mistakes, its revealing quirks and peculiarities. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3vkfb8dakbpkpg7vkdfxete)</span>

> Years later he used to recall, as typical of the man, that when he first began speaking about Mitya with Fyodor Pavlovich, the latter looked for a while as if he had no idea what child it was all about, and was even surprised, as it were, to learn that he had a little son somewhere in the house. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y1xhs4mpqt30t7sffb2tqm)</span>

- [N] More about Dad

- [N] Of course a Fyodor would brag about his sons being taken away and getting his ass beat by his wife's dads widow. 

### id751767997

> If there was anyone to whom the brothers were indebted for their upbringing and education for the rest of their lives, it was to this Yefim Petrovich, a most generous and humane man, of a kind rarely found. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y3va1jxtcthh3nhcn51m7k)</span>

- [N] The boys owe their upbringing and education to Yefim

### id751768108

> of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that as he was growing up he was somehow gloomy and withdrawn, far from timid, but as if he had already perceived by the age of ten that they were indeed living in someone else’s family and on someone else’s charity, that their father was such that it was a shame to speak of him, and so on and so forth. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y3yp8j3jgk67s4xj4y86rd)</span>

- [N] Ivan seems a depressed intellectual 

### id751768637

> plying them with ten-line articles on street incidents, signed “Eyewitness.” These little articles, they say, were always so curiously and quaintly written that they were soon in great demand; and even in this alone the young man demonstrated his practical and intellectual superiority over that eternally needy and miserable mass of our students of both sexes who, in our capitals, from morning till night, habitually haunt the doorways of various newspapers and magazines, unable to invent anything better than the eternal repetition of one and the same plea for copying work or translations from the French. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y45ff691zyky4smntyx6hw)</span>

- [N] Dostoevsky throwing shade at journalists for their shitty writing skills and talking Ivan's skills up.

### id751769089

> it was strange that so learned, so proud, and seemingly so prudent a young man should suddenly appear in such a scandalous house, before such a father, who had ignored him all his life <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y4e65v0a4zharkmdcn2dw9)</span>

- [N] Yet they get along famously... 

### id751769815

> I will add that Ivan Fyodorovich seemed at the time to be a mediator and conciliator between his father and his elder brother, Dmitri Fyodorovich, who had gotten into a great quarrel with his father and had even started formal proceedings against him. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y4qc791c9r6kr1ybh1nc6m)</span>

- [N] Ivan the mediator, bringing the family together.

### id751770454

> Alyosha, was not at all a fanatic, and, in my view at least, even not at all a mystic. I will give my full opinion beforehand: he was simply an early lover of mankind,[1](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#end_en8) and if he threw himself into the monastery path, it was only because it alone struck him at the time and presented him, so to speak, with an ideal way out for his soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness towards the light of love. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y4yag5zr9vm9e77by0hwzw)</span>

### id751770675

> Such memories can be remembered (everyone knows this) even from an earlier age, even from the age of two, but they only emerge throughout one’s life as specks of light, as it were, against the darkness, as a corner torn from a huge picture, which has all faded and disappeared except for that little corner. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y516xwyn7md19azzh4a44t)</span>

- [N] Regarding Alyoshas earliest memories of his dead mother

### id751770801

> he remembered a quiet summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the setting sun (these slanting rays he remembered most of all), an icon in the corner of the room, a lighted oil-lamp in front of it, and before the icon, on her knees, his mother, sobbing as if in hysterics, with shrieks and cries, seizing him in her arms, hugging him so tightly that it hurt, and pleading for him to the Mother of God, holding him out from her embrace with both arms towards the icon, as if under the protection of the Mother of God … and suddenly a nurse rushes in and snatches him from her in fear. What a picture! <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y53qvn3a0tc5w3nk2e1nyp)</span>

- [N] Yes Dostoevsky, what a picture indeed. The narrator is entirely aware of the reader.

### id751771484

> he accepted everything without the least condemnation, though often with deep sadness. Moreover, in this sense he even went so far that no one could either surprise or frighten him <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y57t5ys9twckhrr0yb2gsr)</span>

### id751771843

> He was seldom playful, seldom even merry, but anyone could see at once, at a glance, that this was not from any kind of sullenness, that, on the contrary, he was serene and even-tempered. He never wanted to show off in front of his peers. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y5ez2qx08h0pdhp87cryqw)</span>

### id751771851

### id751772077

> external cynicism <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y5k0bpra0csede8sk91h4y)</span>

- [N] Write something more about [[External Cynicism\|External Cynicism]]. Here it relates to young boys speaking about depraved things, but not yet understanding what the implications of those thoughts are. Alyosha can't stand this sort of talk, he's a pure boy.

### id751772459

> “Here, perhaps, is the only man in the world who, were you to leave him alone and without money on the square of some unknown city with a population of a million, would not perish, would not die of cold and hunger, for he would immediately be fed and immediately be taken care of, and if no one else took care of him, he would immediately take care of himself, and it would cost him no effort, and no humiliation, and he would be no burden to those who took care of him, who perhaps, on the contrary, would consider it a pleasure.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y5wx19n4a5nytzzzh5gcg4)</span>

- [N] Our anti-capitalist socialist Pyotr sums up Alyosha

### id751772715

> he himself did not know and would not at all have been able to explain what it was precisely that suddenly rose up in his soul and irresistibly drew him onto some sort of new, unknown, but already inevitable path. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y60rv8mgq2kwh3gjj1763b)</span>

- [N] We're beginning to talk about fate, free will, destiny here

### id751773983

> He was far from religious; the man probably had never put a five-kopek candle in front of an icon. Strange fits of sudden feelings and sudden thoughts come over such individuals. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y6b12z2t4sp2y9v9tnz6pd)</span>

- [N] Regarding Fyodors erratic behavior

### id751774467

> You see, stupid as I am, I still keep thinking about it, I keep thinking, every once in a while, of course, not all the time. Surely it’s impossible, I think, that the devils will forget to drag me down to their place with their hooks when I die. And then I think: hooks? Where do they get them? What are they made of? Iron? Where do they forge them? Have they got some kind of factory down there? <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y6m6baqjt6fhna2q4p4t6g)</span>

- [N] Holy shit, this dialogue is next level. I've heard a bit about Dostoevskys use of dialogue and how he nails the sort of train of thought of the way in which we talk, with all of its interruptions and detours. Too good, wow. Also, we're talking about a fear of death or hell here, an admission of mortality.

### id751774721

> Il faudrait les inventer,[3](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#end_en10) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y6teyetja1ptw80n12mfh1)</span>

- [N] Also sounds like dad is feeling unworthy of heaven, of his sons love, "if God did not exist then he would have to be invented." Sounds like he's sentimental about his sons decision, knowing its what's best, what he's passionate about, but sad to see him go nonetheless 

### id751774787

> Il faudrait les inventer: “They would have to be invented.” A variation of Voltaire’s Si Dieu n’existait pas , il faudrait l’inventer (“[If God did not exist](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#ref_int_21), he would have to be invented”). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y6xdg10pxwg4j5aj42nk8d)</span>

### id751775497

> Alyosha was at that time a well-built, red-cheeked nineteen-year-old youth, clear-eyed and bursting with health. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y754f1fvqh98zf3pw2b93a)</span>

### id751775566

> Some will say, perhaps, that red cheeks are quite compatible with both fanaticism and mysticism, but it seems to me that Alyosha was even more of a realist than the rest of us. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y76askdnqvgzyj3186tgb6)</span>

### id751775708

> miracles will never confound a realist. It is not miracles that bring a realist to faith. A true realist, if he is not a believer, will always find in himself the strength and ability not to believe in miracles as well, and if a miracle stands before him as an irrefutable fact, he will sooner doubt his own senses than admit the fact. And even if he does admit it, he will admit it as a fact of nature that was previously unknown to him. In the realist, faith is not born from miracles, but miracles from faith. Once the realist comes to believe, then, precisely because of his realism, he must also allow for miracles. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y76k7et8mwgng7aygk8245)</span>

- [N] This is an extremely interesting, well organized concept. I want to dig deeper into this. Miracles don't occur outside of faith, faith allows for miracles. [[Realism\|Realism]]

### id751776437

> he set out upon this path only because at the time it alone struck him and presented him all at once with the whole ideal way out for his soul struggling from darkness to light. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y7jemzfkcqrdxatj082hv9)</span>

### id751776763

### id751776910

> As soon as he reflected seriously and was struck by the conviction that immortality and God exist, he naturally said at once to himself: “I want to live for immortality, and I reject any halfway compromise.” In just the same way, if he had decided that immortality and God do not exist, he would immediately have joined the atheists and socialists (for socialism is not only the labor question or the question of the so-called fourth estate, but first of all the question of atheism, the question of the modern embodiment of atheism, the question of the Tower of Babel built precisely without God, not to go from earth to heaven but to bring heaven down to earth). <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y7s1cth9hwdf8rk966qvq8)</span>

- [N] Interesting passage about. [[Cards/300 - Social Sciences/Socialism\|Socialism]] and [[Atheism\|Atheism]], where socialism is about bringing heaven to earth, not some immortality

### id751778045

> What, then, is an elder? An elder is one who takes your soul, your will into his soul and into his will. Having chosen an elder, you renounce your will and give it to him under total obedience and with total self-renunciation. A man who dooms himself to this trial, this terrible school of life, does so voluntarily, in the hope that after the long trial he will achieve self-conquest, self-mastery to such a degree that he will, finally, through a whole life’s obedience, attain to perfect freedom—that is, freedom from himself—and avoid the lot of those who live their whole lives without finding themselves in themselves. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y86v8s843pde7szcd2xnv4)</span>

### id751778861

> It is also true, perhaps, that this tested and already thousand-year-old instrument for the moral regeneration of man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfection may turn into a double-edged weapon, which may lead a person not to humility and ultimate self-control but, on the contrary, to the most satanic pride—that is, to fetters and not to freedom. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y8hgygv954et593jymppbg)</span>

- [N] Zoe ima the elder, wise and cheerful

### id751779570

> For Alyosha there was no question of why they loved him so much, why they prostrated before him and wept so tenderly just at the sight of his face. Oh, how well he understood that for the humble soul of the simple Russian, worn out by toil and grief, and, above all, by everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world’s, there is no stronger need and consolation than to find some holy thing or person, to fall down before him and venerate him: “Though with us there is sin, unrighteousness, and temptation, still, all the same, there is on earth, in such and such a place, somewhere, someone holy and exalted; he has the truth; he knows the truth; so the truth does not die on earth, and therefore someday it will come to us and will reign over all the earth, as has been promised.” <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y8wjck82n4bs1cxtjvpayw)</span>

- [N] The need and consolation to find some holy thing or person 

### id751780043

> He knew perfectly well that his brother was an atheist. This contempt, if there were any, could not offend him, but still he was waiting with some sort of anxious puzzlement, which he himself did not understand, waiting for his brother to move closer to him. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y934bj58q9fg593sevdm3f)</span>

- [N] Alyosha doesn't judge Ivan for his atheism, but Ivan clearly is judging Alyosha for his religion.

### id751780734

> If any of these quarrelers and litigants could take such a council seriously, it was undoubtedly only his brother Dmitri. The rest would come with frivolous purposes, perhaps offensive to the elder—this Alyosha knew. His brother Ivan and Miusov would come out of curiosity, perhaps of the crudest sort, and his father, perhaps, for some buffoonery or theatrics. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3y9cf7s7mcexcefcp5z0yky)</span>

### id752166050

> Only Petrusha Kalganov took a ten-kopeck piece from his purse and, embarrassed for some reason, hastily shoved it at one woman, saying quickly: “To be shared equally.” None of his companions said anything to him, so there was no point in his being embarrassed; which, when he noticed it, made him even more embarrassed. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j40f1kvg8xf0s31xd7v73er8)</span>

Yet according to the Russian understanding and hope, it is not the Church that needs to be transformed into the state, as from a lower to a higher type, but, on the contrary, the state should end by being accounted worthy of becoming only the Church alone, and nothing else but that.

And therefore I declare that I accept God pure and simple. But this, however, needs to be noted: if God exists and if he indeed created the earth, then, as we know perfectly well, he created it in accordance with Euclidean geometry, and he created human reason with a conception of only three dimensions of space. At the same time there were and are even now geometers and philosophers, even some of the most outstanding among them, who doubt that the whole universe, or, even more broadly, the whole of being, was created purely in accordance with Euclidean geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid cannot possibly meet on earth, may perhaps meet somewhere in infinity. I, my dear, have come to the conclusion that if I cannot understand even that, then it is not for me to understand about God. I humbly confess that I do not have any ability to resolve such questions, I have a Euclidean mind, an earthly mind, and therefore it is not for us to resolve things that are not of this world. And I advise you never to think about it, Alyosha my friend, and most especially about whether God exists or not. All such questions are completely unsuitable to a mind created with a concept of only three dimensions. And so, I accept God, not only willingly, but moreover I also accept his wisdom and his purpose, which are completely unknown to us; I believe in order, in the meaning of life, I believe in eternal harmony, in which we are all supposed to merge, I believe in the Word for whom the universe is yearning, and who himself was ‘with God,’ who himself is God, and so on, and so on and so forth, to infinity.[6](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#end_en131) <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4jgqk09pwgj7d974h78wdz0)</span>

### id754769117

> In my opinion, Christ’s love for people is in its kind a miracle impossible on earth. True, he was God. But we are not gods. Let’s say that I, for example, am capable of profound suffering, but another man will never be able to know the degree of my suffering, because he is another and not me, and besides, a man is rarely willing to acknowledge someone else as a sufferer (as if it were a kind of distinction). And why won’t he acknowledge it, do you think? Because I, for example, have a bad smell, or a foolish face, or once stepped on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering: some benefactor of mine may still allow a humiliating suffering, which humiliates me—hunger, for example; but a slightly higher suffering—for an idea, for example—no, that he will not allow, save perhaps on rare occasions, because he will look at me and suddenly see that my face is not at all the kind of face that, he fancies, a man should have who suffers, for example, for such and such an idea. And so he at once deprives me of his benefactions, and not even from the wickedness of his heart. Beggars, especially noble beggars, should never show themselves in the street; they should ask for alms through the newspapers. It’s still possible to love one’s neighbor abstractly, and even occasionally from a distance, but hardly ever up close. If it were all as it is on stage, in a ballet, where beggars, when they appear, come in silken rags and tattered lace and ask for alms dancing gracefully, well, then it would still be possible to admire them.

These same torturers look upon all other examples of humankind even mildly and benevolently, being educated and humane Europeans, but they have a great love of torturing children, they even love children in that sense. It is precisely the defenselessness of these creatures that tempts the torturers, the angelic trustfulness of the child, who has nowhere to turn and no one to turn to—that is what enflames the vile blood of the torturer. There is, of course, a beast hidden in every man, a beast of rage, a beast of sensual inflammability at the cries of the tormented victim, an unrestrained beast let off the chain, a beast of diseases acquired in debauchery—gout, rotten liver, and so on. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4jkvhsef3w48f4t38kprfgd)</span>

> Much on earth is concealed from US,[10](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#end_en216) but in place of it we have been granted a secret, mysterious sense of our living bond with the other world, with the higher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts and feelings are not here but in other worlds. That is why philosophers say it is impossible on earth to conceive the essence of things. God took seeds from other worlds and sowed them on this earth, and raised up his garden; and everything that could sprout sprouted, but it lives and grows only through its sense of being in touch with other mysterious worlds; if this sense is weakened or destroyed in you, that which has grown up in you dies. Then you become indifferent to life, and even come to hate it. So I think. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4zkz4a5p5jjradc2nvsp82n)</span>

And yet it is impossible to take this spiritual torment from them, for this torment is not external but is within them. And were it possible to take it from them, then, I think, their unhappiness would be even greater because of it. For though the righteous would forgive them from paradise, seeing their torments, and call them to themselves, loving them boundlessly, they would thereby only increase their torments, for they would arouse in them an even stronger flame of thirst for reciprocal, active, and grateful love, which is no longer possible. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4zmmzmj3c1vq4enwcnntr0t)</span>

Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. The white towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn flowers in the flowerbeds near the house had fallen asleep until morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens, the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars … Alyosha stood gazing and suddenly, as if he had been cut down, threw himself to the earth.
> He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. “Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears … ,” rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and “he was not ashamed of this ecstasy.” It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, “touching other worlds.” He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh, not for himself! but for all and for everything, “as others are asking for me,” rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind—now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter, steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. “Someone visited my soul in that hour,” he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words …

> Jealousy! “Othello is not jealous, he is trustful,” Pushkin observed,[1](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#end_en236) and this one observation already testifies to the remarkable depth of our great poet’s mind. Othello’s soul is simply shattered and his whole world view clouded because his ideal is destroyed. Othello will not hide, spy, peep: he is trustful. On the contrary, he had to be led, prompted, roused with great effort to make him even think of betrayal. A truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossible to imagine all the shame and moral degradation a jealous man can tolerate without the least remorse. And it is not that they are all trite and dirty souls. On the contrary, it is possible to have a lofty heart, to love purely, to be full of self-sacrifice, and at the same time to hide under tables, to bribe the meanest people, and live with the nastiest filth of spying and eavesdropping. Othello could in no way be reconciled with betrayal—not that he could not forgive, but he could not be reconciled—though his soul was gentle and innocent as a babe’s. Not so the truly jealous man: it is hard to imagine what some jealous men can tolerate and be reconciled to, and what they can forgive! Jealous men forgive sooner than anyone else, and all women know it. The jealous man (having first made a terrible scene, of course) can and will very promptly forgive, for example, a nearly proven betrayal, the embraces and kisses he has seen himself, if, for example, at the same time he can somehow be convinced that this was “the last time” and that his rival will disappear from that moment on, that he will go to the end of the earth, or that he himself will take her away somewhere, to some place where this terrible rival will never come. Of course, the reconciliation will only last an hour, because even if the rival has indeed disappeared, tomorrow he will invent another, a new one, and become jealous of this new one. And one may ask what is the good of a love that must constantly be spied on, and what is the worth of a love that needs to be guarded so intensely? But that is something the truly jealous will never understand, though at the same time there happen, indeed, to be lofty hearts among them. It is also remarkable that these same lofty-hearted men, while standing in some sort of closet, eavesdropping and spying, though they understand clearly “in their lofty hearts” all the shame they have gotten into of their own will, nevertheless, at least for that moment, while standing in that closet, will not feel any pangs of remorse. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5ce4fg3q1p5bw5bdpsvmmj2)</span>

> He had a strange sort of dream, somehow entirely out of place and out of time. It seemed he was driving somewhere in the steppe, in a place where he had served once long ago; he is being driven through the slush by a peasant, in a cart with a pair of horses. And it seems to Mitya that he is cold, it is the beginning of November, and snow is pouring down in big, wet flakes that melt as soon as they touch the ground. And the peasant is driving briskly, waving his whip nicely, he has a long, fair beard, and he is not an old man, maybe around fifty, dressed in a gray peasant coat. And there is a village nearby—black, black huts, and half of the huts are burnt, just charred beams sticking up. And at the edge of the village there are peasant women standing along the road, many women, a long line of them, all of them thin, wasted, their faces a sort of brown color. Especially that one at the end—such a bony one, tall, looking as if she were forty, but she may be only twenty, with a long, thin face, and in her arms a baby is crying, and her breasts must be all dried up, not a drop of milk in them. And the baby is crying, crying, reaching out its bare little arms, its little fists somehow all blue from the cold.
> “Why are they crying? Why are they crying?” Mitya asks, flying past them at a great clip.
> “The wee one,” the driver answers, “it’s the wee one crying.” And Mitya is struck that he has said it in his own peasant way: “the wee one,” and not “the baby.” And he likes it that the peasant has said “wee one”: there seems to be more pity in it.
> “But why is it crying?” Mitya insists, as if he were foolish, “why are its little arms bare, why don’t they wrap it up?”
> “The wee one’s cold, its clothes are frozen, they don’t keep it warm.”
> “But why is it so? Why?” foolish Mitya will not leave off.
> “They’re poor, burnt out, they’ve got no bread, they’re begging for their burnt-down place.”
> “No, no,” Mitya still seems not to understand, “tell me: why are these burnt-out mothers standing here, why are the people poor, why is the wee one poor, why is the steppe bare, why don’t they embrace and kiss, why don’t they sing joyful songs, why are they blackened with such black misery, why don’t they feed the wee one?”
> And he feels within himself that, though his questions have no reason or sense, he still certainly wants to ask in just that way, and he should ask in just that way. And he also feels a tenderness such as he has never known before surging up in his heart, he wants to weep, he wants to do something for them all, so that the wee one will no longer cry, so that the blackened, dried-up mother of the wee one will not cry either, so that there will be no more tears in anyone from that moment on, and it must be done at once, at once, without delay and despite everything, with all his Karamazov unrestraint.
> “And I am with you, too, I won’t leave you now, I will go with you for the rest of my life,” the dear, deeply felt words of Grushenka came from somewhere near him. And his whole heart blazed up and turned towards some sort of light, and he wanted to live and live, to go on and on along some path, towards the new, beckoning light, and to hurry, hurry, right now, at once!

He was now perfectly on pitch, though he was still somewhat worried: he felt that he was overly excited, and that he had told about the goose, for example, too openheartedly, while Alyosha had kept silent all through the story and looked serious, so that it gradually began to rankle the vain boy: “Is he silent because he despises me, thinking that I’m seeking his praise?

If Alyosha had said anything now, the matter would have ended there, but Alyosha did not respond, and “his silence could well be contemptuous,” and at that Kolya became quite vexed.

> apart from the main reason prompting him to take such a step, the cause also lay in a certain unhealing scratch left on his heart by one little remark of Smerdyakov’s, that it was supposedly in his, Ivan’s, interest that his brother be convicted, because then the amount of the inheritance for himself and Alyosha would go up from forty to sixty thousand.

He runs for his pistols, which he had pawned to the official Perkhotin, and at the same time, as he runs, he pulls all his money out of his pocket, for which he had just spattered his hands with his father’s blood. Oh, money is what he needs most of all now: Karamazov dies, Karamazov shoots himself, this will be remembered!

But the pistol will reconcile everything, the pistol is the only way out, there is no other, and beyond—I do not know whether Karamazov thought at that moment of ‘what lies beyond’[1](private://read/01j3vctb3vsqwtyht4zqeae7tc/#end_en344) or whether a Karamazov could think, in Hamlet fashion, of what lies beyond.

Second, the remote, encouraging dream that the fatal ending was still a long way off, was at least not near—perhaps only the next day, only in the morning, would they come and take him.

I precisely think that at the start of the procession the condemned man, sitting in the cart of shame, must feel precisely that there is still an endless life ahead of him. Now, however, the houses are going past, the cart is moving on—oh, that’s nothing, it’s still such a long way to the turn down the second street, and so he still looks cheerfully to right and left at those thousands of indifferently curious people whose eyes are fastened on him, and he still fancies he is the same sort of man as they are. But here comes the turn down the other street—oh, it’s nothing, nothing, still a whole street to go.

> But you yourself were shouting that Karamazov is broad, you yourself were shouting about the two extreme abysses Karamazov can contemplate. Karamazov is precisely of such a nature, with two sides, two abysses, as can stop amid the most unrestrained need of carousing if something strikes him on the other side. And the other side is love, precisely this new love that flared up in him like powder, and for this love he needs money, he has more need of it, oh! much more need of it even than of carousing with this same beloved. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j669v8nd4tetrt83mnk2vjpe)</span>

Despair can be malicious and implacable, and the suicide, as he was taking his life, may at that moment have felt twice as much hatred for those whom he had envied all his life. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j66b1x54dyhf0mewzwa7tr8n)</span>

Outwardly passionate and cruel, they are capable, for instance, of loving a woman to the point of torment, and inevitably with a lofty and spiritual love. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j66becfztgqg12bf1kben3nb)</span>

You will see, you will hear how his soul will tremble and be horrified: ‘Is it for me to endure this mercy, for me to be granted so much love, and am I worthy of it?’ he will exclaim! Oh, I know, I know that heart, it is a wild but noble heart, gentlemen of the jury. It will bow down before your deed, it thirsts for a great act of love, it will catch fire and resurrect forever. There are souls that in their narrowness blame the whole world. But overwhelm such a soul with mercy, give it love, and it will curse what it has done, for there are so many germs of good in it. The soul will expand and behold how merciful God is, and how beautiful and just people are. He will be horrified, he will be overwhelmed with repentance and the countless debt he must henceforth repay. And then he will not say, ‘I am quits,’ but will say, ‘I am guilty before all people and am the least worthy of all people.’ In tears of repentance and burning, suffering tenderness he will exclaim: ‘People are better than I, for they wished not to ruin but to save me!’ <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j66cjh07dct5z61fj4grmhba)</span>

You hear a lot said about your education, yet some such beautiful, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man stores up many such memories to take into life, then he is saved for his whole life.
