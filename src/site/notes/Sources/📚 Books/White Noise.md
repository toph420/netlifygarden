# White Noise

> [!summary]+
> **summary**:: *White Noise* by Don DeLillo follows the life of Jack Gladney, a professor of Hitler studies, his wife Babette, and their children as they navigate the complexities of contemporary American life. The novel explores themes of consumerism, media saturation, the fear of death, and the search for meaning in a postmodern world. The "Airborne Toxic Event" forces the family to confront their mortality, while Jack's investigation into Babette's involvement with a mysterious drug called Dylar further delves into their anxieties and the blurred lines between reality and simulation. The book culminates with a sense of unease and the characters' altered perceptions of their environment.



> [!summary]- Synopsis
> Part 1: "Waves and Radiation"
>  * Setting the Scene:
>    * This section establishes the Gladney family's life in a small college town. We meet Jack, the professor of Hitler studies, Babette, and their blended family of children from previous marriages.
>    * DeLillo immerses us in the sensory overload of their world: the constant hum of televisions, radios, and the pervasive presence of consumer goods.
>    * The opening scenes, particularly the "most photographed barn in America" and the ritual of the station wagons arriving at the college, highlight the novel's themes of manufactured reality and mass culture.
>  * The Texture of Everyday Life:
>    * We see the Gladneys' daily routines, their conversations, and their interactions with their environment. These interactions are filled with a strange kind of academic and media driven dialog.
>    * The book establishes the constant undercurrent of fear of death, that is present in Jacks life.
>    * The characters' fascination with language and information is a key element, as they constantly interpret and reinterpret the world around them.
>  * Hints of Unease:
>    * Even in the seemingly ordinary moments, there's a sense of unease. The constant flow of information and the artificiality of their surroundings create a feeling of detachment from reality.
> 
> Part 2: "The Airborne Toxic Event"
>  * The Crisis:
>    * The "Airborne Toxic Event" dramatically disrupts the Gladneys' lives. A chemical spill releases a toxic cloud, forcing them to evacuate.
>    * This event amplifies the characters' anxieties about death and the fragility of their existence.
>  * Fear and Uncertainty:
>    * The evacuation becomes a surreal and chaotic experience, highlighting the breakdown of social order and the unreliability of information.
>    * Jack's obsession with his potential exposure to the toxin intensifies his fear of death.
>    * The nature of information, and the way that information is spread, and how it effects the population is a major theme within this section.
>  * Existential Dread:
>    * This section delves into the psychological impact of fear and uncertainty, as the characters struggle to cope with the perceived threat.
> 
> Part 3: "Dylarama"
>  * The Search for Answers:
>    * Jack's investigation into Babette's involvement with Dylar, a mysterious drug that supposedly eliminates the fear of death, drives the narrative.
>    * This section further emphasizes the books focus on the fear of death, and the lengths people will go to, to try and escape that fear.
>  * Confronting Mortality:
>    * Jack's pursuit of answers leads him into a dangerous and surreal confrontation, forcing him to confront his own mortality.
>    * The unreliablity of modern science, and the dangers of pursuing easy answers is shown heavily within this portion of the book.
>  * A Distorted Reality:
>    * The lines between reality and simulation become increasingly blurred as Jack's quest takes him into a world of paranoia and uncertainty.
>  * Return to a Changed World:
>    * The novel concludes with a return to a semblance of normalcy, but the Gladneys' world is forever altered by the events they've experienced.
>    * The final supermarket scene, emphasizes the constant barrage of consumerism, and the almost religious like reverence that people hold for it.

## Thoughts

My first DeLillo book. It's an easier read that tackles a lot of deep philosophical questions that we're all constantly asking ourselves.   
  
What is death, and love? Why do we fear death? How are we able to continue living in the face of death?

The heat that floats out of the subways and the tunnels. It's always fifteen degrees hotter in the cities. Heat rises from the sidewalks and falls from the poisoned sky. The buses breathe heat. Heat emanates from crowds of shoppers and office workers. The entire infrastructure is based on heat, desperately uses up heat, breeds more heat.

It has an identity, a sense of achievement. You've evolved an entire system around this figure, a structure with countless substructures and interrelated fields of study, a history within history.

They were there to attend tributes to the dead. Processions, songs, speeches, dialogues with the dead, recitations of the names of the dead. They were there to see pyres and flaming wheels, thousands of flags dipped in salute, thousands of uniformed mourners. There were ranks and squadrons, elaborate backdrops, blood banners and black dress uniforms. Crowds came to form a shield against their own dying. To become a crowd is to keep out death.

When the line began to pale, producing a series of aesthetes and incompetents, they gave the name to any man who married into the family, within reason. I was the first of these and kept expecting to hear a note of overrefined irony in their voices when they called me by that name. I thought that when tradition becomes too flexible, irony enters the voice. Nasality, sarcasm, self-caricature and so on. They would punish me by mocking themselves.

When the steep glide began, people rose, fell, collided, swam in their seats. Then the serious screaming and moaning began. Almost immediately a voice from the flight deck was heard on the intercom: "We're falling out of the sky! We're going down! We're a silver gleaming death machine!"

An encouraging question under the circumstances, if you didn't think about it too long, and there was no time to think right now.

I didn't think Steffie knew what *déjà vu* meant, but it was possible Babette had told her. *Déjà vu,* however, was no longer a working symptom of Nyodene contamination. It had been preempted by coma, convulsions, and miscarriage. If Steffie had learned about *déjà vu* on the radio but then missed the subsequent upgrading to more deadly conditions, it could mean she was in a position to be tricked by her own apparatus of suggestibility. She and Denise had been lagging all evening. They were late with sweaty palms, late with nausea, late again with *déjà vu.* What did it all mean? Did Steffie truly imagine she'd seen the wreck before or did she only imagine she'd imagined it? Is it possible to have a false perception of an illusion? Is there a true *déjà vu* and a false *déjà vu?* I wondered whether her palms had been truly sweaty or whether she'd simply imagined a sense of wetness.

We've never been so close to it, so familiar with its habits and attitudes. We know it intimately. But it continues to grow, to acquire breadth and scope, new outlets, new passages and means. The more we learn, the more it grows. Is this some law of physics? Every advance in knowledge and technique is matched by a new kind of death, a new strain. Death adapts, like a viral agent. Is it a law of nature? Or some private superstition of mine? I sense that the dead are closer to us than ever. I sense that we inhabit the same air as the dead. Remember Lao Tse.

Now we are free to remember it, to experience it as familiar material." "Why are so many people having these episodes now?" "Because death is in the air," he said gently. "It is liberating suppressed material. It is getting us closer to things we haven't learned about ourselves.

Some put hankies to their faces, others left abruptly in disgust. Whatever caused the odor, I sensed that it made people feel betrayed. An ancient, spacious and terrible drama was being compromised by something unnatural, some small and nasty intrusion. Our eyes began to burn. The crowd broke up. It was as though we'd been forced to recognize the existence of a second kind of death. One was real, the other synthetic.

Far away the grandparents huddle in a chair, eagerly sharing the receiver as carrier waves modulate into audible signals. It is the voice of their grandson, the growing boy whose face appears in the snapshots set around the phone. Joy rushes to their eyes but it is misted over, infused with a sad and complex knowing. What is the young- • ster saying to them? His wretched complexion makes him unhappy? He wants to leave school and work full-time at Foodland, bagging groceries? He tells them he *likes* to bag groceries. It is the one thing in life he finds satisfying. Put the gallon jugs in first, square off the six-packs, double-bag the heavy merch. He does it well, he has the knack, he *sees* the items arranged in the bag before he touches a thing. It's like Zen, gramma. I snap out two bags, fit one inside the other. Don't bruise the fruit, watch the eggs, put the ice cream in a freezer bag. A thousand people pass me every day but no one ever sees me. I like it, gramma, it's totally un-threatening, it's how I want to spend my life. And so they listen sadly, loving him all the more, their faces pressed against the sleek Trimline, the white Princess in the bedroom, the plain brown Rotary in granddad's paneled basement hideaway. The old gentleman runs a hand through his thatch of white hair, the woman holds her folded specs against her face. Clouds race across the westering moon, the seasons change in somber montage, going deeper into winter stillness, a landscape of silence and ice.

> Mink took one hand from his crotch, grabbed more tablets from his pocket, hurled them toward his open mouth. His face appeared at the end of the white room, a white buzz, the inner surface of a sphere. He sat up, tearing open his shirt pocket to find more pills. His fear was beautiful. He said to me, "Did you ever wonder why, out of thirty-two teeth, these four cause so much trouble? I'll be back with the answer in a minute."
> I fired the gun, the weapon, the pistol, the firearm, the automatic. The sound snowballed in the white room, adding on reflected waves. I watched blood squirt from the victim's midsection. A delicate arc. I marveled at the rich color, sensed the color-causing action of nonnucleated cells. The flow diminished to a trickle, spread across the tile floor. I saw beyond words. I knew what red was, saw it in terms of dominant wavelength, luminance, purity. Mink's pain was beautiful, intense. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwg4be54333tfnezyn5dq36)</span>

> Is it better to commit evil and attempt to balance it with an exalted act than to live a resolutely neutral life? I know I felt virtuous, I felt blood-stained and stately, dragging the badly wounded man through the dark and empty street. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwgayg6pzn9bn8p0rj2nznx)</span>

> There was a wheelchair ramp, which meant I could drag Mink to the front door without banging his head on the concrete steps. I got him out of the car, clutched his sleek foot and moved up the ramp. He held one hand at his midsection to stanch the flow. The gun hand dragged behind. Dawn. There was a spaciousness to this moment, an epic pity and compassion. Having shot him, having led him to believe he'd shot himself, I felt I did honor to both of us, to all of us, by merging our fortunes, physically leading him to safety. I took long slow strides, pulling his weight. It hadn't occurred to me that a man's attempts to redeem himself might prolong the elation he felt when he committed the crime he now sought to make up for. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwggcwyr12a1cmfg28d2pc9)</span>

> "All the others. The others who spend their lives believing that *we* still believe. It is our task in the world to believe things no one else takes seriously. To abandon such beliefs completely, the human race would die. This is why we are here. A tiny minority. To embody old things, old beliefs. The devil, the angels, heaven, hell. If we did not pretend to believe these things, the world would collapse."

> "Our pretense is a dedication. Someone must appear to believe. Our lives are no less serious than if we professed real faith, real belief. As belief shrinks from the world, people find it more necessary than ever that *someone* believe. Wild-eyed men in caves. Nuns in black. Monks who do not speak. We are left to believe. Fools, children. Those who have abandoned belief must still believe in us. They are sure that they are right not to believe but they know belief must not fade completely. Hell is when no one believes. There must always be believers. Fools, idiots, those who hear voices, those who speak in tongues. We are your lunatics. We surrender our lives to make your nonbelief possible. You are sure that you are right but you don't want everyone to think as you do. There is no truth without fools. We are your fools, your madwomen, rising at dawn to pray, lighting candles, asking statues for good health, long life." <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwgy3y0hqdjpevwh9qb21wr)</span>

> This waiting is introverted, uneven, almost backward and shy, tending toward silence. What else do we feel? Certainly there is awe, it is all awe, it transcends previous categories of awe, but we don't know whether we are watching in wonder or dread, we don't know what we are watching or what it means, we don't know whether it is permanent, a level of experience to which we will gradually adjust, into which our uncertainty will eventually be absorbed, or just some atmospheric weirdness, soon to pass. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwhj2rdx75awf9qj7cgg2tq)</span>

> The supermarket shelves have been rearranged. It happened one day without warning. There is agitation and panic in the aisles, dismay in the faces of older shoppers. They walk in a fragmented trance, stop and go, clusters of well-dressed figures frozen in the aisles, trying to figure out the pattern, discern the underlying logic, trying to remember where they'd seen the Cream of Wheat. They see no reason for it, find no sense in it. The scouring pads are with the hand soap now, the condiments are scattered. The older the man or woman, the more carefully dressed and groomed. Men in Sansabelt slacks and bright knit shirts. Women with a powdered and fussy look, a self-conscious air, prepared for some anxious event. They turn into the wrong aisle, peer along the shelves, sometimes stop abruptly, causing other carts to run into them. Only the generic food is where it was, white packages plainly labeled. The men consult lists, the women do not. There is a sense of wandering now, an aimless and haunted mood, sweet-tempered people taken to the edge. They scrutinize the small print on packages, wary of a second level of betrayal. The men scan for stamped dates, the women for ingredients. Many have trouble making out the words. Smeared print, ghost images. In the altered shelves, the ambient roar, in the plain and heartless fact of their decline, they try to work their way through confusion. But in the end it doesn't matter what they see or think they see. The terminals are equipped with holographic scanners, which decode the binary secret of every item, infallibly. This is the language of waves and radiation, or how the dead speak to the living. And this is where we wait together, regardless of age, our carts stocked with brightly colored goods. A slowly moving line, satisfying, giving us time to glance at the tabloids in the racks. Everything we need that is not food or love is here in the tabloid racks. The tales of the supernatural and the extraterrestrial. The miracle vitamins, the cures for cancer, the remedies for obesity. The cults of the famous and the dead. <span class='highlight-link'>[🔗](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwhzeb0n7e7c0h4e46t32sm)</span>
