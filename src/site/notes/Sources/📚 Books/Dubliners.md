> [!Ava]- AI Highlight Analysis
> Take a look at all of my highlights, denoted here by unique ids. Ignore the single word highlights, some contain definitions below them, those can be combined in a "Words" list with definitions of each which we will do later. Given the other highlights, and the personal notes I made below them for some of them, give me a short essay describing the themes of the book, use quotes from the highlights and include outside sources if you find it helpful.

- [N] 3.5/5 - great story, nostalgic, the type of story that changes you as a kid even though the situation is mostly benign and ordinary, though rebellious. The boys skip school and hop on a ferry boat, they encounter an old guy, a guy with traumas and opinions, reminiscing on his own life, instilling fear in the boy as he talks about young girls and whipping boys that talk to them.
