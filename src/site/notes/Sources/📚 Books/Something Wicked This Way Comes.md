> But you take October, now. School's been on a month and you're riding easier in the reins, jogging along. You got time to think of the garbage you'll dump on old man Prickett's porch, or the hairy-ape costume you'll wear to the YMCA the last night of the month. And if it's around October twentieth and everything smoky-smelling and the sky orange and ash grey at twilight, it seems Hallowe'en will never come in a fall of broomsticks and a soft flap of bedsheets around corners. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2t5nsg3e9k227jjtgt17nh9)</span>

> But two boys, far up the gentle slope, lying on the grass. Of a like size and general shape, the boys sat carving twig whistles, talking of olden or future times, content with having left their fingerprints on every movable object in Green Town during summer past and their footprints on every open path between here and the lake and there and the river since school began. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2t69ctq4y3ms9csrsq6vmjr)</span>

- [N] This dialogue and prose is amazing. The creepy atmosphere of this scene of the wind blowing, two young boys listening to an ominous lightning rod salesmen that's practiced his shpiel so many times he's lost count, the boys dead serious, taking it all in as gospel, and the foreboding warning of death and fire. The noises, the imagery

> But here in the special night, a land bricked with paper and leather, anything might happen, always did. Listen! and you heard ten thousand people screaming so high only dogs feathered their ears. A million folk ran toting cannons, sharpening guillotines; Chinese, four abreast, marched on forever. Invisible, silent, yes, but Jim and Will had the gift of ears and noses as well as the gift of tongues. This was a factory of spices from far countries.

- [N] Bradbury allows us to wonder who Wills dad is. Is he a Librarian? Is he just a book nerd that spends time at the library? At the perfect time, when you think you figured it out, he lets you know that he's a janitor. Not what you had in mind. It also clues us into the socio economic status of at least Wills family.

> And Will? Why he's the last peach, high on the summer tree. Some boys walk by and you cry, seeing them. They feel good, they look good, they are good. Oh, they're not above peeing off a bridge, or stealing an occasional dime-store pencil sharpener; it's not that. It's just, you know, seeing them pass, that's how they'll be all their life; they'll get hit, hurt, cut, bruised, and always wonder why, why does it happen? how can it happen to them? <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2t896tbv055v24m0fhewv42)</span>

> But Jim, now, he knows it happens, he watches for it happening, he sees it start, he sees it finish, he licks the wound he expected, and never asks why; he knows. He always knew. Someone knew before him, a long time ago, someone who had wolves for pets and lions for night conversants. Hell, Jim doesn't know with his mind. But his body knows. And while Will's putting a bandage on his latest scratch, Jim's ducking, waving, bouncing away from the knockout blow which must inevitably come. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2t8a9pakj3swdp7gmah8fxs)</span>

> Some nights, abed, Will put his ear to the wall to listen, and if his folks talked things that were right, he stayed, and if not right he turned away. If it was about time and passing years or himself or town or just the general inconclusive way God ran the world, he listened warmly, comfortably, secretly, for it was usually Dad talking. He could not often speak with Dad anywhere in the world, inside or out, but this was different. There was a thing in Dad's voice, up, over, down, easy as a hand winging soft in the air like a white bird describing flight pattern, made the ear want to follow and the mind's eye to see.
> Â  Â  And the odd thing in Dad's voice was the sound truth makes being said. The sound of truth, in a wild roving land of city or plain country lies, will spell any boy. Many nights Will drowsed this way, his senses like stopped clocks long before that half-singing voice was still. Dad's voice was a midnight school, teaching deep fathom hours, and the subject was life. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2taafh25e8y2qfehhgxx2ca)</span>

Once, wandering in the Louvre, he had found women like this, washed in summer colour and kept in paint. Once, as a boy, sneaking the cool grottoes behind a motion picture theatre screen, on his way to a free seat, he had glanced up and there towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a women's face as he had never seen it since, of such size and beauty built of milk-bone and moon-flesh, at to freeze him there alone behind the stage, shadowed by the, motion of her lips, the bird-wing flicker of her eyes, the snow-pale-death-shimmering illumination from her cheeks. <span class='highlight-link'>[ðŸ”—](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2tb136td44n6sgex7mzx19h)</span>
