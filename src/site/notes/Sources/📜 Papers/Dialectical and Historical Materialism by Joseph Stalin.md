> [!abstract]+
> **abstract**:: Dialectical and Historical Materialism by Joseph Stalin is a seminal work that outlines the Marxist theory of history and society, emphasizing the role of material conditions in shaping social structures and ideas. Stalin explains the principles of dialectical materialism, a method of analysis based on the interrelation of opposing forces and the idea that change occurs through contradictions within material reality. He extends this framework to historical materialism, which posits that the development of society is driven by economic forces and class struggle, with the mode of production determining the political and ideological superstructure. Stalinâ€™s work aims to provide a scientific basis for understanding history and society, reinforcing the Marxist-Leninist view that socialism will inevitably emerge from the contradictions of capitalism.

### id0YV2EDP9I

<mark class="hltr-blue">"My dialectic method," says Marx, "is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, ... the process of thinking which, under the name of 'the Idea,' he even transforms into anindependent subject, is the demiurgos (creator) of the real world, andthe real world is only the external, phenomenal form of 'the Idea.' Withme, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material worldreflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought."(Marx, Afterword to the Second German Edition of Volume I ofCapital.)</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=5&annotation=YV2EDP9I)

### id044A6N2AN

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics does not regard the process of development as a simple process of growth, where quantitative changes do not lead to qualitativechanges, but as a development which passes from insignificant and imperceptible quantitative changes to open' fundamental changes' to qualitative changes; adevelopment in which the qualitative changes occur not gradually, but rapidly andabruptly, taking the form of a leap from one state to another; they occur notaccidentally but as the natural result of an accumulation of imperceptible and gradual quantitative changes.</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=8&annotation=44A6N2AN) 

### id0S6JHI36L

<mark class="hltr-blue">Describing dialectical development as a transition from quantitative changes to qualitative changes, Engels says:"In physics ... every change is a passing of quantity into quality, as a result of a quantitative change of some form of movement eitherinherent in a body or imparted to it. For example, the temperature ofwater has at first no effect on its liquid state; but as the temperature of liquid water rises or falls, a moment arrives when this state of cohesion changes and the water is converted in one case into steam and in theother into ice...</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=8&annotation=S6JHI36L)

### id05HNNEC4L

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics holds that internal contradictions are inherent inall things and phenomena of nature, for they all have their negative and positive sides,a past and a future, something dying away and something developing; and that the struggle between these opposites, the struggle between the old and the new, between that which is dying away and that which is being born, between that which isdisappearing and that which is developing, constitutes the internal content of the process of development, the internal content of the transformation of quantitativechanges into qualitative changes.</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=9&annotation=5HNNEC4L) 

### id099CA4NBQ

<mark class="hltr-blue">"In its proper meaning," Lenin says, "dialectics is the study of the contradiction within the very essence of things."

### id0FK6FAXGA

<mark class="hltr-green">Further, if the world is in a state of constant movement and development, if the dying away of the old and the upgrowth of the new is a law of development, then it is clearthat there can be no "immutable" social systems, no "eternal principles" of privateproperty and exploitation, no "eternal ideas" of the subjugation of the peasant to thelandlord, of the worker to the capitalist.</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=10&annotation=FK6FAXGA)

### id0LRZY7SQ7

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Contrary to idealism, which asserts that only our consciousness really exists, and that the material world, being, nature, exists only in our consciousness' in our sensations,ideas and perceptions, the Marxist philosophical materialism holds that matter, nature,being, is an objective reality existing outside and independent of our consciousness;that matter is primary, since it is the source of sensations, ideas, consciousness, andthat consciousness is secondary, derivative, since it is a reflection of matter, areflection of being; that thought is a product of matter which in its development hasreached a high degree of perfection, namely, of the brain, and the brain is the organ of thought; and that therefore one cannot separate thought from matter withoutcommitting a grave error.</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=12&annotation=LRZY7SQ7) 

### id0IA93SY99

<mark class="hltr-blue">Engels says:"The question of the relation of thinking to being, the relation of spirit to nature is the paramount question of the whole of philosophy.... Theanswers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primacy of spirit to nature ...
comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded nature as primary, belong to the various schools of materialism." (Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 329.)</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=12&annotation=IA93SY99)

### id0MC6VXKIJ

<mark class="hltr-red">The fall of the utopians, including the Narodniks, anarchists and Socialist-Revolutionaries, was due, among other things to the fact that they did not recognize the primary role which the conditions of the material life of society play in thedevelopment of society, and, sinking to idealism, did not base their practical activitieson the needs of the development of the material life of society, but, independently of and in spite of these needs, on "ideal plans" and "all-embracing projects", divorcedfrom the real life of society.</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=16&annotation=MC6VXKIJ)

<mark class="hltr-orange">The basis of the relations of production under the socialist system, which so far has been established only in the U.S.S.R., is the social ownership of the means ofproduction. Here there are no longer exploiters and exploited. The goods produced aredistributed according to labor performed, on the principle: "He who does not work,neither shall he eat." Here the mutual relations of people in the process of productionare marked by comradely cooperation and the socialist mutual assistance of workerswho are free from exploitation. Here the relations of production fully correspond tothe state of productive forces; for the social character of the process of production isreinforced by the social ownership of the means of production.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8T6NJEJ?page=25&annotation=9DJUMZEE)
