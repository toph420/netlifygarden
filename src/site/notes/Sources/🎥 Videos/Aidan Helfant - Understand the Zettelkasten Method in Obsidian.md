## Notes
- [[How to Take Smart Notes\|How to Take Smart Notes]] 
	- Unique ID, Content, Footer (related, references)
	- Relate notes through links and references to original sources
	- Ditch the rigid folder based structure
- Top down or **Bottom up** approach
	- Ask our system what our research is telling us
- [09:21](https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU#t=561.3989678378754) 
	- Overview of Workflow
	- Zettelkasten Workflow
		- **Capture**
			- Tasks, audio memos, calendar, highlights
			- [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Readwise Reader\|Readwise Reader]]
			- All get sent to [[Readwise\|Readwise]] and sent to [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] using the Readwise Official Plugin
		- **Organize**
			- LYT Kit by Nick Milio using ACCESS structure
			- Create daily/weekly reviews using "Lifestyle Design" (see his video about journaling)
		- **Distill**
			- Fleeting or Literature
			- Atomic/Zettels
			- Evergreens
			- Maps of Content
		- **Express**
			- Youtube Channel, Digital Garden, Newsletter, Podcast

	- Types of Notes
		- Fleeting notes (notes off the top)
		- Literature notes(from [[Readwise\|Readwise]])
		- Atomic/Zettels notes (written in own words, reference back to literature notes, single focal point idea with background ideas and evidence)
		- Permanent/🌲(Most important, can exist forever)
		- Maps of Content (MOCs, most useful, can be any of the above)
- [17:39](https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU#t=1059.7152880572205) 
	- ACCESS folder structure
		- Encounter (Passing and growing ideas, new notes go here)
		- Atlas (MOCs, dashboards, logs, datascopes)
		- Calendar (Time based, reviews, meetings)
		- Cards (Helps build and connect ideas, people, quotes)
		- Extras (Support material
		- Sources (Lit notes, articles, podcasts, papers, videos, tweets)
		- Spaces (Life, schoolwork, content creation, newsletters)
		- Home Note (Highest order MOCs)
- [21:11](https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU#t=1271.0603379656677) 
	- Capture
	- Capture stuff that resonates with you!
	- Capture what confuses you, surprising
	- Define a capture toolkit (books, articles, pods, conversations, etc.)
	- Define 12 questions to help define you and what to capture
	- [[Readwise\|Readwise]], where is [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Readwise Reader\|Readwise Reader]] invite!
	- New Note template, keep it simple
		- up section, whats above this, parent
		- related section, link to related that arent linked in the body
		- resources, using footnotes with little numbers, sometimes link to article, sometimes link to the citation
		- tags for status (seedlings)
		- highlights
		- possibly add back in the boatbox for notes that are super fleeting or quick one offs
- [28:27](https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU#t=1707.2916719313355) 
	- Distill
	- Take atomic notes and distill into 🌲
	- Efforts over projects
- [29:57](https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU#t=1797.7904198703002) 
	- Organize
	- Connect using
		- reminds me
		- similar because
		- different because
		- important because
	- Idea compass
		- North - where idea comes from
		- West - link to something similar, reinforce
		- South - something this diea can lead to
		- East - link to something that competes, transforming into something else
	- Backlinks are helpful with this, as are Unlinked mentions
	- Local graph view, show within 2 connections
	- Notes will come back up over and over again
	- Collect notes at the squeeze point and convert to MOC
- [34:29](https://youtu.be/wvAZ9-hmWQU#t=2069.2797090362396) 
	- Express
	- This is the goal of the Zettelkasten system
	- Content created is just an assemblage of notes in the system
	- The last step, but sometimes the easiest
- Following through with anything for more than 2 years will change your life and over time everything will start to make sense.
