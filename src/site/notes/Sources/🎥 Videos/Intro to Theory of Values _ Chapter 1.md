> In summary, Chapter 1 of Marx's Das Kapital examines the building blocks of capitalist society, focusing on labor, commodities, and value. Commodities are objects that satisfy human needs and can be traded, having both qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Marx presents a theory of values (use value, exchange value, and value) and introduces the concept of labor time. He also discusses the twofold nature of labor within commodities and the social division of labor, as well as the money form of value, which measures exchange value and compares commodities.

> [!todo]- Actionable Takeaways
> Step-by-step Plan based on Chapter 1 of Das Kapital:
> 
> 1. **Identify the relevant commodities** in your life and their connection to capitalism. Make a list of commodities that satisfy your human needs and think about their use value and exchange value.
>   - Actionable task: Write down five commodities you regularly interact with and their corresponding use and exchange values.
> 
> 2. **Understand the labor involved** in the production of the commodities you interact with. Reflect on the social division of labor and the production process behind these commodities.
>   - Actionable task: For each of the five commodities, research the labor and production process involved.
> 
> 3. **Examine the use value and exchange value** of the commodities you have identified. Analyze if the value you experience mainly comes from use value or exchange value.
>   - Actionable task: For each commodity, assess if its worth aligns more with its use or exchange value.
> 
> 4. **Determine the socially necessary labor time** in relation to the value of the commodities. Consider how the required labor time to produce these commodities affects their value.
>   - Actionable task: Estimate the labor time involved in producing the commodities and how this relates to their value.
> 
> 5. **Acknowledge the twofold nature of labor** (useful labor and differences in labor) within the commodities. Consider how various types of labor create different use values and exchange values.
>   - Actionable task: Identify the various types of labor involved in the production of your listed commodities and their impact on use and exchange values.
> 
> 6. **Consider the role of money** in the value and exchange process. Reflect on money's quantitative characteristics, noting that it lacks qualitative dimensions.
>   - Actionable task: Analyze the role of money in your interactions with the listed commodities and its influence on your perception of their value.
> 
> 7. **Apply the 80/20 principle** to prioritize your understanding of capitalist society and its relationship with commodities, labor, and value. Focus on the key concepts that provide the most insight into this system.
>   - Actionable task: Based on your analysis of the commodities and their values, identify and prioritize the top two or three concepts that are most crucial in understanding capitalism and its effects on society.


## Notes

- Commodities
	- Through physical properties it can satisfy a need and is able to be traded
	- Food, wood, metal, etc
	- Only become commodities in relation to humans
	- Qualitative and Quantitative
- [[+ Encounters/Theory of Values\|Theory of Values]]
	- **Use value**
		- utility of a thing, limited by physical properties, dependent on qualitiatve properties
		- Glass cup: can hold water, drink from it, because of properties of glass
			- Without me drinking from it, there is no utility, so no value
		- A thing can have use value without having value, ie Air we breathe or creating something for yourself through labor
	- **exchange value**
		- value created entirely by humans
		- influenced by quantity when comapared to other comm.
			- ie 4 corn, 2 iron
		- Why though? Qualitiative is completely different
			- Because of they are both products of labor
	- **Value**
		- main way we expereicnce value is through exchange value, but dont forget about use value
- Labor time
	- Many comm. only have use value because some degree of human labor
		- ie a hatchet has value because of the labor, not just raw materials
	- Human labor creating use values is not unique to capitalism
		- A person can create something with use value, consume it themselves, but not created to trade, its not a comm.
	- With comm. creation, labor creates use value and links with exchange value
	- How much time was needed to create the comm. 
		- Socially necessary (average time and skill)
	- Tech goes up, labor time goes down, exchange value goes down too
	- Always changing, ie skill, science, practical application, etc.
	- If a thing has no utility it has no value, even if it has labor
- Two fold nature of labor within comm.
	- Creator of use value, and a unit of measure which we measure exchange value
- Useful labor
		- "productive activity of a definte kind, excercised witha. definite aim"
		- a coat and roll of linen, coat has higher value, has more useful labor within it
	- division of labor is necessary for production of comm. but prod of comm. is not necessary condition for division of labor
		- ie native american communities with division of labor but no prod. of comm.
	- Anything of material wealth that is not spontaneous produce of nature owes itself to special productive activity
- Social division of labor
	- In community of com. producers, division and different sorts of useful labor = social division of labor
		- ie coat and paper towel are just two different modes of epndging human labor pwoer, 
	- More use values, larger gap between different values of different work
- Units of simple labor (doesnt explain lol)
	- If productive power remains constant, sum of value of coats increases with quanity.
	- Ie if production time doubles, value doubles, halves, value halves
- Through money we see exchange value realized, not trading commodities.
	- money is void of qualitiatve charactersitics of value
	- solely looking at exchange values, not use value, quantitiatve characteristics
		- made up as units of human labor
	- Access to use value is expanded
	- CAPITALISM
