### The Ideal Point of Departure

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The ideal is to take just enough of what is already known ‚Äì amelody, a chord-sequence, a harmonic mode or tone-system ‚Äì as a point of departurefor the shared production and enjoyment of what is radically new.</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=12&annotation=TUZCT8HE)

> The ideal creative process involves starting with something known and using it as a springboard for producing something entirely new and shared.

### Marx, Jazz, and Schizophrenia as a Social Ideal

<mark class="hltr-green">In The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon Marx describes bourgeois revolution as an occasion on which real social relations could not live up to the expectations created by its own rhetoric (‚Äúliberty, equality, fraternity‚Äù), as an occasion on which ‚Äúthe phrase went beyond the content‚Äù; and he does so in order to contrast that situation with the revolution to come, where ‚Äúthe content wouldgo beyond the phrase.‚Äù In a similar way, symphony orchestras can only hope their performances rise to the genius of the composer whose work they are performing:they hope their content lives up to the pre-existing phrase. (Here the past, as Marxput it, weighs like a dead hand upon the living.) In jazz, by contrast, the past enablesrather than constrains the present: the improvised performance always exceeds the pre-existing musical composition or structure in complexity, nuance, and originality:the whole point is that the content go beyond the phrase. As an illustration of theprocess of schizophrenia, then, jazz not only presents to my mind an ideal instance of human relations and interpersonal dynamics but actually suggests a social ideal: the use of accumulated wealth as a basis for the shared production and enjoymentof life in the present rather than the reproduction and reinforcement of powerstructures from the past.</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=12&annotation=4HJ9YS9U)

- [N] Marx: bourgeois revolution (phrase beyond content) vs coming revolution (content beyond phrase).
- [N] Symphony: content must live up to phrase (past constrains present).
- [N] Jazz: performance exceeds composition (past enables present).
- [N] Jazz as illustration of schizophrenia process.
- [N] Jazz suggests a social ideal: using wealth for present production/enjoyment rather than reinforcing past power structures.

> Using the analogy of Marx's critique of bourgeois revolution and the difference between symphony performance and jazz improvisation, the text presents jazz as an illustration of the schizophrenic process, suggesting it as a model for a social ideal where the content (life in the present) exceeds the phrase (pre-existing structures) and wealth is used for shared production rather than reinforcing the past.

### 1INTRODUCTION


### Capitalism and Schizophrenia

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Capitalism fosters schizophrenia, in brief, because the quantitative calculationsof the market replace meaning and belief-systems as the foundation of society. In a first approximation, then, we could define schizophrenia as a form of ‚Äúunlimited semiosis‚Äù ‚Äì in the psyche as well as throughout society ‚Äì that emerges when fixed meanings and beliefs are subverted by the cash nexus under capitalism.</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=15&annotation=T6XZU98D)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Every extension of capital ‚Äì both geographical(imperialism) and psychological (marketing) ‚Äì entails the simultaneous elimination of extant meanings and beliefs, and hence the extension of schizophrenia: ‚Äúallthat is solid melts into air,‚Äù as Marx put it.</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=15&annotation=I2Y6CIJV)

- [N] Capitalism fosters schizophrenia by replacing meaning/belief with market calculations.
- [N] Schizophrenia defined as "unlimited semiosis" where fixed meanings are subverted by the cash nexus.
- [N] Extension of capital (imperialism, marketing) eliminates existing meanings/beliefs, extending schizophrenia.

> Capitalism promotes schizophrenia by dissolving fixed meanings and belief systems, replacing them with the quantitative calculations of the market ("cash nexus"). This process, seen in both geographical and psychological extensions of capital, leads to "unlimited semiosis" where traditional structures melt away.

#on/capitalism #on/schizophrenia


### Schizophrenia vs Paranoia

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If we understand schizophrenia(in this first approximation) to designate unlimited semiosis, a radically fluid andextemporaneous form of meaning, paranoia by contrast would designate an absolute system of belief where all meaning was permanently fixed and exhaustively defined by a supreme authority, figure-head, or god.</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92WHSE)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">And paranoia represents what is archaic incapitalism, the resuscitation of obsolete, or traditional, belief-centered modes of social organization, whereas schizophrenia designates capitalism‚Äôs positive potential: freedom, ingenuity, permanent revolution.</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=16&annotation=C29XL7NA)

- [N] Schizophrenia is unlimited semiosis, fluid meaning.
- [N] Paranoia is an absolute system of belief with fixed meaning defined by authority.
- [N] Paranoia is archaic in capitalism (resuscitation of traditional modes).
- [N] Schizophrenia is capitalism's positive potential (freedom, ingenuity, revolution).

> Schizophrenia is characterized as unlimited, fluid meaning (unlimited semiosis), while paranoia represents a fixed, absolute system of belief dictated by authority. Within capitalism, paranoia embodies archaic social organization modes, whereas schizophrenia signifies capitalism's inherent potential for freedom and revolution.

#on/schizophrenia #on/paranoia


### The Aim of Schizoanalysis

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The primary aim of schizoanalysis is to take this preferable tendency to the limit, and indeed push it through the limits, imposed on it by capitalist paranoia: schizophrenia as revolutionary breakthrough rather than psychologicalbreakdown</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=16&annotation=CZHMGFAM)

- [N] The aim of schizoanalysis is to push the schizophrenic tendency to its revolutionary potential.
- [N] Schizoanalysis seeks schizophrenia as a revolutionary breakthrough, not psychological breakdown.

> Schizoanalysis aims to harness and amplify the revolutionary potential of schizophrenia, pushing it beyond the constraints imposed by capitalist paranoia, viewing it as a force for breakthrough rather than merely psychological disintegration.

### How it works (1): the materialisms of Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche


### Critiquing Freud and Marcuse on Scarcity

<mark class="hltr-yellow">While Deleuze and Guattari agree that Freud must be historicized, they disagreeon the status of scarcity: according to schizoanalysis, scarcity is not merely socially managed, but is socially fabricated in order to found and secure social organization in various forms. Following Bataille, Deleuze and Guattari insist that societies havealways produced a surplus, no matter how dire the circumstances may have appeared and however minimal that surplus may have been: social organizationrevolves around the determination of how and by whom that surplus will be expended or distributed. Scarcity never had to be overcome by the development of productive forces, since it was already a fabrication from the start: the performanceprinciple could not have become irrational when productive forces became sufficient,for it was never rational to begin with.</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92XDM)

- [N] D&G agree Freud must be historicized but disagree on scarcity.
- [N] Schizoanalysis: Scarcity is socially fabricated, not a natural state.
- [N] Societies always produce a surplus; organization is about distributing this surplus.
- [N] Scarcity was never rational or necessary to overcome, it was a fabrication.

> Contra Freud (and Marcuse), D&G argue that scarcity is not a natural condition overcome by productive forces, but a social fabrication used to organize societies around the distribution of an inherent surplus. Thus, the performance principle linked to overcoming scarcity was never truly rational.

#on/critique #on/scarcity


### Social vs Psychic Repression and Reich

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Oppressive‚Äìrepressive authority first extends outwardfrom family to society, from father to chief, priest, or boss, in Marcuse‚Äôs mythicalhistorical schema, only to be eclipsed by the overwhelming and all-encompassing power of rationalized social authority (in post-Enlightenment bourgeois society).But this schema reverses the real direction of determination, according to Deleuzeand Guattari: for schizoanalysis, social oppression‚Äì repression in society at large is always primary with respect to psychic repression in the individual. Moreover</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=18&annotation=FK46UY59)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the form of social oppression determines the form of psychic repression, and sincethe former varies historically (as Marcuse also insists), the latter does not remainconstant, and thus does not always take the form of the Oedipus complex. Taking the Oedipus as the model ‚Äì even only as a ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù model ‚Äì for repression endsup thwarting Marcuse‚Äôs own effort to historicize Freudian theory</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=19&annotation=5PYT7QHW)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Reich‚Äôs position is categorical: psychic repression depends onsocial oppression. That is why Deleuze and Guattari consider him the ‚Äútrue founder of a materialist psychiatry‚Äù: ‚ÄúReich was the first to raise the problem of the relationship between desire and the social field (and went further than Marcuse)‚Äù (118/141). In particular, Reich raised the problem of fascism in terms of how it was infact desired by the masses, rather than as a matter of ideology or deception; for‚Äú[according to Reich] the masses were not deceived, they desired fascism, and that is what has to be explained‚Äù (257/306).14 Any explanation that grants psychicrepression even an autonomy from, much less a precedence over, social oppressionrepression risks becoming an apology for the latter</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=19&annotation=CLKBNXTA)

- [N] Marcuse's schema reverses the true direction: social oppression is primary over psychic repression.
- [N] The form of social oppression determines the form of psychic repression.
- [N] Taking Oedipus as a model for repression thwarts historicizing Freud because Oedipus is not a constant form.
- [N] Marcuse on the symbolic Oedipal complex
- [N] D&G see Reich as the "true founder of a materialist psychiatry" because he insisted psychic repression depends on social oppression.
- [N] Reich raised the problem of how the masses desired fascism, seeing desire as linked to the social field.
- [N] Reich on desiring fascism
- [N] Granting psychic repression autonomy risks excusing social oppression.

> Against Marcuse's view, D&G assert that social oppression is primary and determines psychic repression, arguing that using the Oedipus complex as a universal model hinders historicization. They credit Reich as the founder of materialist psychiatry for insisting on this dependency and for analyzing how desire is linked to the social field, even in the context of desiring fascism, arguing that explanations granting psychic repression autonomy risk excusing social oppression.

### Schizoanalysis and the Death Instinct

<mark class="hltr-yellow">schizoanalysis will show how death becomes an instinct in the course of historical developments leading up to the contemporary society that Freud‚Äôs theory reflects</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92GV)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The supposed ‚Äúprogress‚Äù of Western civilization entails an endlessly increasingburden of guilt: modern society, Freud and Nietzsche agree, is ‚Äúneurotic‚Äù or ‚Äúsick,‚Äù and at the root of the illness, Brown insists, lies the inability to face death. According to Nietzsche, whoever affirms life must thereby affirm death; indeed, only thosestrong enough to affirm death can truly affirm life. As Brown puts it, the inability to face death amounts to a repression of the death instinct; his rewriting of Freudinsists on matching the analysis of the repression of sexuality, or Eros, about whichpsychoanalysis has had a lot to say, with analysis of the avoidance of death, therepression of the death instinct, or Thanatos, about which it has said all too little.</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=21&annotation=SQLGV6MT)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Brown also invokes Nietzsche in his revision of the Freudian analysis of money.The primary and original function of money, Brown agrees with Nietzsche, is not to facilitate trade but to create and pay debts and thereby both foster and assuageguilt. In archaic society, Brown argues, such debts were owed primarily to the gods, and they were in principle dischargeable. Indeed they were discharged periodically,giving rise to and reflecting a finite cyclical view of time, as contrasted with the infinite linear time of modernity.18 Ironically, it is when the debt comes to be owedprimarily to other people rather than to a deity (with the secularization ofProtestantism and the emergence of capitalism), that it becomes infinite and impossible to discharge: unlike the gods, no one person or persons can be taken tobe responsible for everyone, so all the debt-payments in the world cannot expunge the lasting sense of guilt. Despite or even because of the centrality of money in modern society, the burden of guilt assumes historically unprecedented proportions:no degree of material acquisition, no amount of compulsory work can balance the accounts. Only a complete refusal of the Protestant‚Äìcapitalist culture of guilt and debt, Brown suggests, will free us from history, understood in this way as a form of neurosis.</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=22&annotation=7YWP5HVH)

- [N] Schizoanalysis posits that death becomes an instinct through historical development leading to contemporary society.
- [N] Western civilization's progress increases guilt; modern society is "sick" (Freud/Nietzsche), rooted in inability to face death (Brown).
- [N] Nietzsche: Affirming life requires affirming death. Brown: Inability to face death is repression of the death instinct (Thanatos).
- [N] Brown on money, debt, and guilt (agreeing with Nietzsche): Money's primary function is to create/pay debts, foster/assuage guilt.
- [N] Brown on money
- [N] Archaic debt (to gods) was dischargeable, linked to cyclical time.
- [N] Modern debt (to people, capitalism) is infinite, impossible to discharge, creating unprecedented guilt.
- [N] Brown suggests refusing Protestant-capitalist culture of guilt/debt frees from history-as-neurosis.

> Schizoanalysis intends to show how death becomes an instinct historically. The text discusses how Western civilization's "progress" leads to increased guilt and an inability to face death (Thanatos), seen by Brown as a repression of the death instinct. It then explores Brown's argument, shared with Nietzsche, that money's primary role is to create debt and guilt. Modern capitalism, unlike archaic societies, makes debt infinite and inescapable, leading to pervasive guilt that material acquisition cannot resolve, suggesting that freedom comes from rejecting this culture of guilt and debt.

### Political vs Libidinal Economy

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari will refuse to separate political and libidinaleconomy, and will in effect combine them, instead. Yet, at the same time, it is one oftheir primary objects of investigation, capitalism, that first created and still maintains the split between the two.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=20&annotation=864D3W4Z)

- [N] D&G refuse to separate political and libidinal economy, aiming to combine them.
- [N] Capitalism is identified as the system that created and maintains the split between the two.

> Deleuze and Guattari aim to unite political and libidinal economy, two domains split apart by capitalism, which is a key focus of their analysis.

### Critiquing Brown on the Family

<mark class="hltr-blue">‚Äúwhereas neither the state nor the antinomy of Master and Slave can be grantedto be given by nature,‚Äù Brown wants to suggest, ‚Äúthe institution of the family can.‚Äù</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92AV4)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari would disagree: theinstitution of the family cannot be taken for granted.</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=23&annotation=MMFQEDGR)

- [N] Brown suggests the family institution is given by nature.
- [N] D&G disagree, stating the family cannot be taken for granted.

> The text presents Brown's view that the family institution is natural, immediately followed by Deleuze and Guattari's disagreement, asserting that the family cannot be assumed as a given.

### Schizoanalytic Model: Social Organization and Psychic Repression

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Their solution will be not to subordinate socio-historical explanation to universalizing psychology, but to propose an apparentlyparadoxical model of the psyche, as we‚Äôll see, wherein the mechanisms that carry out repression at the same time free the human organism from instinctualdetermination, so that it is the form of social organization that determines whetherpsychic repression serves social oppression or escapes it.</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=23&annotation=MQT8WLE8)

- [N] D&G's model doesn't subordinate social history to psychology.
- [N] The psyche's repressive mechanisms also free the organism from instinct.
- [N] The form of social organization determines if psychic repression serves oppression or enables escape.

> Schizoanalysis proposes a model where psychic repression, while enacting constraint, simultaneously liberates the organism from instinctual determination. Crucially, the social organization dictates whether this psychic process reinforces social oppression or provides an avenue of escape.

#on/schizoanalysis #on/repression


### Anxiety, Repression, and Repetition

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For Deleuze and Guattari (followingReich), repression causes anxiety, and eliminating social oppression and the kindsof psychic repression that stem from it is the key to reducing anxiety and therebyfreeing the human organism from death-inspired and deadening repetition.According to Deleuze, repetition is not in and of itself compulsive: it only becomesso when death gets converted into an instinct.</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92HJV)

- [N] Following Reich, D&G state that repression causes anxiety.
- [N] Eliminating social oppression and resulting psychic repression reduces anxiety.
- [N] Reducing anxiety frees the organism from death-inspired, deadening repetition.
- [N] Repetition is not inherently compulsive; it becomes so when death becomes an instinct.

> Drawing on Reich, D&G link anxiety to repression, arguing that reducing anxiety and escaping compulsive repetition requires eliminating social oppression and the psychic repression it produces. Repetition itself is only compulsive when death is transformed into an instinct.

#on/anxiety #on/repression #on/repetition


### Nietzsche: Will-to-Power and Repetition as Variation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze, however, by placing the concept of will-to-power at the center</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=23&annotation=ZFQSM86K)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">of his reading of Nietzsche, thereby construes repetition not as compulsion but as variation, innovation, and creation ‚Äì as the exercise of life-force which naturally aims always at its own continued health and expansion.25 Brown, in a word, wants to end history as neurosis, so that humankind might ‚Äúenter that state of Beingwhich was the goal of his Becoming;‚Äù26 for Deleuze and Guattari, Being is a delusion which traps desire in the snare of representation and thereby represses it: their goal is to release desire from Being so it can enter more freely into Becoming. Far from being a neurosis, history for Deleuze and Guattari is the chance that the development of productive forces beyond capitalism and the expansion of will-topower beyond nihilism will lead to greater freedom rather than enduring servitude.</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=24&annotation=I6CBCC8W)

- [N] Deleuze's reading of Nietzsche centers on will-to-power.
- [N] Repetition is seen as variation, innovation, creation ‚Äì exercise of life-force.
- [N] This contrasts with repetition as compulsion.
- [N] Brown aims to end history-as-neurosis to reach a state of Being.
- [N] D&G see Being as a delusion that traps desire in representation and represses it.
- [N] D&G's goal is to release desire into Becoming.
- [N] History, for D&G, is a chance for freedom through developing forces beyond capitalism and will-to-power beyond nihilism.

> Through Nietzsche's concept of will-to-power, repetition is reinterpreted not as compulsion but as variation and creation, an expression of life-force. Unlike interpretations that seek a state of Being, D&G aim to release desire into Becoming, viewing history as a potential path towards greater freedom beyond capitalism and nihilism.

### Capitalism and Axiomatization

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Capitalist society, according to Deleuze and Guattari, is distinct from all othersin that it is based on the ‚Äúcash nexus‚Äù of impersonal market relations. Capitalistsociety, they agree with Horkheimer and Adorno, ‚Äúis ruled by equivalence [and] makes the dissimilar comparable by reducing it to abstract quantities.‚Äù31 Such rendering-equivalent is performed via the market, according to Deleuze and Guattari, by the basic mechanism of the capitalist economy: what they call the process of ‚Äúaxiomatization,‚Äù</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=24&annotation=NXCW5VFM)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari consider axiomatization to be ambivalent: it spawns recoding, which is its negative moment as we‚Äôll see, but also fosters decoding, which Deleuze and Guattari consider a positive result.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92AS)

- [N] Capitalism is distinct due to the cash nexus of impersonal market relations.
- [N] Capitalism rules by equivalence, reducing dissimilar things to abstract quantities.
- [N] This process is called "axiomatization".
- [N] Axiomatization is ambivalent: it produces recoding (negative) and decoding (positive).

> Capitalism is characterized by the impersonal "cash nexus" and the process of "axiomatization," which reduces diverse elements to abstract, comparable quantities via the market. This process is seen as ambivalent, generating both negative recoding and positive decoding.

### General Historical Materialism: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and the Family

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Although Marx and Nietzsche are both acutely critical ofcontemporary society, their objects of analysis are quite different ‚Äì psychology and culture for Nietzsche, economics for Marx ‚Äì and their conclusions are practicallyopposite: emancipation from capitalism is to be sought through collective social transformation for Marx, while emancipation from nihilism is to be sought throughpersonal self-transformation for Nietzsche. If they nevertheless can be brought together in Anti-Oedipus, it is because of their approach rather than their objectsor conclusions: both, I would argue, are ‚Äì in the most general sense of the term historical materialists.32 Both, that is to say, take as their starting points the body, on one hand ‚Äì its productive force, its will-to-power ‚Äì and the historical expansion of ‚Äúwhat the body can do‚Äù (in Spinoza‚Äôs phrase), on the other. Moreover, both see history critically in terms of developing human forces whose further development is hampered by the very structures ‚Äì of belief, of social organization ‚Äì that untilrecently have spurred their development. Capitalism and asceticism have contributed immensely to what human beings can do, but now stand in the way of all that theycould do ‚Äì and must therefore be done away with, superseded.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=25&annotation=PW3U5X6I)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari take the development of a general historical materialism one step further, by adding psychoanalysis into the mix as well: it is not just Protestant Christianity in Northern Europe but the nuclear family itself, as the strictly capitalist form of human reproduction, that produces asceticism. Withits focus on the dynamics of the nuclear family, psychoanalysis is thus crucial tounderstanding how ascetic psychology gets produced under, and in turncontributes to, capitalist social organization ‚Äì even though Freud mistook the capitalist family-form for a universal form of human reproduction, and therefore requires historicizing himself.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=26&annotation=AT29Z2NT)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">money is no longer conceived solely as a means of exchange andaccumulation, but also as a means of imposing debt and guilt. Consequently, justas there are distinct modes of production for Marx, so are there distinct modes ofguilt-formation, linked to what Deleuze and Guattari will call modes of ‚Äúantiproduction‚Äù; what psychoanalysis is able to show in this connection is that thenuclear family imposes a modern form of guilt that is neither truly political nor economic in nature.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92CRYI4E)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the projects of ending asceticism andnihilism through politico-cultural change and ending exploitation and alienation through socio-economic change both need to take libido and the crushing of desireby the nuclear family into account.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=26&annotation=BCCQJCTW)

- [N] Marx and Nietzsche combo
- [N] Marx (economics, collective transformation) and Nietzsche (psychology/culture, personal transformation) differ in objects/conclusions.
- [N] They can be brought together as historical materialists: starting from the body/productive force/will-to-power and the historical expansion of "what the body can do".
- [N] Both see history critically: structures that helped development now hamper it (capitalism, asceticism).
- [N] D&G add psychoanalysis to form a general historical materialism.
- [N] The nuclear family (a capitalist form) produces asceticism.
- [N] Psychoanalysis helps understand ascetic psychology under capitalism, though Freud needs historicizing as he saw the family as universal.
- [N] Money imposes debt/guilt (modes of "anti-production").
- [N] The nuclear family imposes a modern form of guilt (neither purely political nor economic).
- [N] Ending asceticism/nihilism (Nietzschean) and exploitation/alienation (Marxist) requires considering libido and the crushing of desire by the nuclear family.

> D&G unite Marx and Nietzsche as historical materialists who start from the body's capacity, seeing history critically where past structures now impede potential. They extend this by adding psychoanalysis to show how the nuclear family, a capitalist form, produces asceticism and a unique form of guilt linked to debt and anti-production. They argue that overcoming asceticism, nihilism, exploitation, and alienation requires understanding how the family crushes desire.

### How it works (2): the critical operators drawn from Kant, Marx, andFreud


### Operator 1: Kant and critique


### Kant and Transcendental Critique

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Ofcrucial importance for Kant was the idea that, since these processes were constitutive of conscious thought, they provided immanent criteria for judging something to be either knowledge or metaphysics, depending on whether it was based on legitimate or illegitimate use of the three syntheses.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92FT59)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">following Kantian usage, then, Deleuzeand Guattari call their critique of psychoanalytic metaphysics a ‚Äútranscendental‚Äù critique: it will proceed by distinguishing immanent from metaphysical operations in the unconscious.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=27&annotation=A5SN6PZX)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In a similar way, but speaking not in the name of reason but in that of desire andespecially schizophrenic desire, Deleuze and Guattari insist that the unconscious operates according to a specific set of syntheses to process or constitute experience, and that psychoanalysis must either be shown to conform to these processes or else stand condemned as metaphysical.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=27&annotation=96Y5S3NH)

- [N] syntheses of apprehension, reproduction, and recognition
- [N] Kant's syntheses are constitutive of conscious thought, providing immanent criteria for distinguishing knowledge from metaphysics.
- [N] D&G apply a "transcendental" critique to psychoanalysis, distinguishing immanent from metaphysical operations in the unconscious.
- [N] They argue the unconscious operates according to specific syntheses, and psychoanalysis must conform to these or be deemed metaphysical.

> Drawing on Kant's transcendental critique, which distinguishes valid knowledge from metaphysics based on the legitimate use of constitutive syntheses, D&G apply this approach to the unconscious. They propose the unconscious operates via specific syntheses, and psychoanalysis is judged as metaphysical if it fails to conform to these processes inherent to desire.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Schizoanalysis thus involves social as well as epistemo-psychological critique: if schizoanalysis condemns psychoanalysis as metaphysical, it will be so condemnedas a reflection or projection of capitalism; as an historical-materialist psychiatry,schizoanalysis will call not just for psychoanalytic doctrine but for social relationsin general to conform to the syntheses of the unconscious. Schizoanalysis is thus revolutionary in a Marxist sense, whereas psychoanalysis is not. Yet here Deleuzeand Guattari‚Äôs Marxist analyses acquire a distinctly Nietzschean foundation: thesocial ideal is not what best represents the interests of the proletariat (or humanityas a whole) but what least contradicts the ‚Äúlogic‚Äù of the unconscious and the activebodily forces animating its syntheses; revolutionary society, too, will have to conform to these unconscious processes or else stand condemned as repressive.</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=28&annotation=7L5JQ3IH)

- [N] Schizoanalysis includes social and epistemo-psychological critique.
- [N] Psychoanalysis, if metaphysical, is condemned as a projection of capitalism.
- [N] As historical-materialist psychiatry, schizoanalysis calls for social relations to conform to the syntheses of the unconscious.
- [N] Schizoanalysis is revolutionary (Marxist sense).
- [N] D&G's analysis has a Nietzschean foundation: the social ideal conforms to the logic of the unconscious and bodily forces.
- [N] Revolutionary society must conform to unconscious processes or be repressive.

> Schizoanalysis functions as both a transcendental (epistemo-psychological) and a revolutionary (social) critique. It judges psychoanalysis as metaphysical if it reflects capitalism, and calls for social relations to align with the syntheses of the unconscious. Rooted in a Nietzschean understanding of the unconscious and bodily forces, its social ideal is what best aligns with these processes, demanding that revolutionary society also conform to avoid repression.

### Schizoanalysis as Materialist Analysis

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If the first frame of reference makes schizoanalysis critical in the Kantian sense ofthe term, the second frame of reference then makes it critical and revolutionary in a Marxist sense: ‚Äúschizoanalysis,‚Äù Deleuze and Guattari insist after presenting and recapitulating the three syntheses of the unconscious, ‚Äúis at once a transcendentaland a materialist analysis‚Äù (109/130).</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=28&annotation=9CF5L2P6)

- [N] Kantian critique makes schizoanalysis transcendental.
- [N] Marxist critique makes it revolutionary and materialist.
- [N] Schizoanalysis is both transcendental and materialist analysis.

> Building on its Kantian transcendental aspect, schizoanalysis's Marxist framework renders it a critical and revolutionary materialist analysis.

### Marx on Abstract Labor and Universal History

<mark class="hltr-yellow">So the historical appearance of abstract labor in reality under capitalismconstitutes only a precondition for a universal history, according to Marx, not its actual foundation; and this in two senses.41 First of all, capitalism does not constitutea substantive foundation for universal history (whereby other modes of productionwould secretly resemble capitalism), because it is different from, not the same as,all other modes of production: no other social formation ‚Äúfrees‚Äù labor from objectivepre-determination by making it a commodity; labor appears as a real abstraction only at the end of the process leading up to capitalism.42 More important, thathistorical process has not actually reached its end: labor has been freed from</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=29&annotation=R9237KPF)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">objective pre-determination under capitalism only to be re-enslaved, at the moment of its sale as a commodity, to external determination by capital.43 The result is that labor continually reproduces its alienated and alienating conditions of enslavementon an ever-larger scale, as Marx‚Äôs critique demonstrates. Whereas the apparentobjective movement of capital is merely reflected in the representations of Ricardoand Smith, with Marx‚Äôs critique of bourgeois political economy capitalism attainsthe point of autocritique and history can become universal: humankind can now envisage and set itself the task of freeing productive activity from any and allexternal, alien determinations‚Äìincluding the most subtle, abstract, and impersonalof all, that of capital itself.</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=30&annotation=Q9VCZ3IG)

- [N] Abstract labor under capitalism is a precondition for universal history, not its foundation.
- [N] Capitalism differs from other modes by freeing labor from pre-determination, making it a commodity (labor as a real abstraction appears late).
- [N] Labor is freed only to be re-enslaved by capital upon sale.
- [N] This reproduces alienation and enslavement.
- [N] Marx's critique allows capitalism to reach autocritique, enabling universal history.
- [N] Humankind can now aim to free productive activity from all external determinations, including capital.

> The text discusses Marx's view that abstract labor under capitalism is a precondition, not the foundation, for universal history. Capitalism differs from other modes by "freeing" labor from pre-determination, but then re-enslaves it to capital. Marx's critique enables capitalism to reach a point of "autocritique," allowing humanity to envision freeing productive activity from all external determinations, including capital itself.

### Applying Autocritique to Freud and Oedipus

<mark class="hltr-blue">Deleuze and Guattari insistthat ‚Äúthe same thing must be said of Freud‚Äù ‚Äì who is thus understood as ‚Äúthe Luther and the Adam Smith of psychiatry‚Äù: his greatness lies in having determined the essence or nature of desire, nolonger in relation to objects, aims or even sources‚Ä¶but as an abstract, subjective essence ‚Äì libido or sexuality. But he still relates this essence to the family [and to]‚Ä¶Oedipus.</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=30&annotation=U4UCD46N)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Even after discovering the nature of passion not in relation to its objects or aims but rather as indeterminate desire, as libidinal energy in general, Freud then betrays the logic of the unconscious by re-alienating desire onto the Oedipus complex andsubordinating it to the family triangle as its ultimate determination. Psychoanalysis, too, thus merely reflects the apparent objective movement of the nuclear family,itself a product of capitalism, and does not attain the point of autocritique.</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=30&annotation=M5H4F9J2)

<mark class="hltr-green">So just as capitalism makes universal history possible through its difference rather than its identity ‚Äì by freeing productive activity in principle from all previous forms of external pre-determination, even though it in fact resubjects labor to capitalas the most abstract form of external determination ‚Äì so do the Oedipus and Oedipal psychoanalyses similarly participate in universal history: not ‚Äì pace Freud ‚Äì asthemselves the universal form and truth of desire, but through the recognition inprinciple of untrammeled desire as abstract subjective essence, as libido, despitethe subsequent reenslavement of that desire in fact and in theory to the nuclearfamily and the Oedipus as its most private and abstract metaphysical representation. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Deleuze and Guattari allow, despite the title of their book, ‚ÄúOedipus isnevertheless the universal of desire, the product of universal history ‚Äì but on one condition, which is not met by Freud: that Oedipus be capable‚Ä¶of conducting its autocritique‚Äù (271/323).44 In schizoanalysis, the Oedipus becomes capable at last of conducting its autocritique</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=30&annotation=9JBJS2LP)

- [N] D&G apply the idea of autocritique to Freud.
- [N] Freud's greatness was discovering desire as abstract subjective essence (libido).
- [N] Freud betrayed this by re-alienating desire onto Oedipus and the family.
- [N] Psychoanalysis reflects the nuclear family (a capitalist product) and doesn't reach autocritique.
- [N] Oedipus participates in universal history not as the universal truth of desire, but by recognizing desire *in principle* as abstract essence (libido).
- [N] This is despite the re-enslavement of desire to the family/Oedipus.
- [N] Oedipus is the universal of desire *only if* it can conduct its autocritique, which Freud failed to do.
- [N] Schizoanalysis enables Oedipus's autocritique.

> D&G critique Freud using the concept of autocritique derived from Marx. While acknowledging Freud's key discovery of desire as abstract libido, they argue he betrayed this by re-subordinating it to the Oedipus complex and the nuclear family, failing to reach the point of autocritique. They posit that Oedipus participates in universal history only if it can critique itself, a task undertaken by schizoanalysis.

### Desiring-Production and Social-Production

<mark class="hltr-blue">‚Äúthe discovery of production in general and without distinction, as it appears in capitalism, is the identical discovery of both political economy and psychoanalysis, beyond the determinate systems of representation‚Äù (302/360)</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BJ3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Schizoanalysis, in other words, will want to translatedesire and labor from their respective ‚Äúdeterminate systems of representation‚Äù(psychoanalysis and political economy) into the concepts of ‚Äúdesiring-production‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial-production,‚Äù precisely in order to stress their common derivation from‚Äúproduction in general and without distinction‚Äù as it appears under capitalism.</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=31&annotation=HUTNK7IG)

<mark class="hltr-blue">one of the main tasks of Anti-Oedipus, we learn in the last chapter,will be to demonstratewhy, at the same time [that] it discovers the subjective essence of desire and labor ‚Äì a common essence inasmuch as it is the activity of productionin general‚Ä¶capitalism [is] continually re-alienating this essence‚Ä¶in a repressive machine that divides the essence in two, and maintains it divided ‚Äì abstract labor on one hand, abstract desire on the other: political economyand psychoanalysis, political economy and libidinal economy.(302‚Äì3/360)</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92B)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari insist that thereis an ‚Äúidentity of nature‚Äù between social-production and desiring-production, butalso a ‚Äúdifference in regime.‚Äù45 The difference in regime enables schizoanalysis tocritique the organization of social-production in the name of desiring-production (as will become clear in Chapter 2), once their identity of nature is realized. And ironically enough (as we will see in Chapter 4), their identity of nature becomesvisible only under capitalism where the difference in regime between the two is</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92HD7)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">most pronounced.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=32&annotation=APYKQNNE)

- [N] Discovery if desire and labor
- [N] Capitalism reveals "production in general", which is the common discovery of political economy (labor) and psychoanalysis (desire).
- [N] Schizoanalysis translates desire/labor into "desiring-production" and "social-production" to highlight their common derivation from production in general under capitalism.
- [N] A main task of Anti-Oedipus is to show how capitalism re-alienates this common essence, dividing it into abstract labor (political economy) and abstract desire (psychoanalysis/libidinal economy).
- [N] Social-production and desiring-production have an "identity of nature" but a "difference in regime".
- [N] The difference in regime allows schizoanalysis to critique social-production using desiring-production as a standard.
- [N] The identity of nature becomes visible under capitalism, where the difference in regime is most pronounced.

> Capitalism reveals a common essence of "production in general," which underlies both labor (political economy) and desire (psychoanalysis). Schizoanalysis re-conceptualizes these as "social-production" and "desiring-production" to emphasize this identity of nature. A key task of *Anti-Oedipus* is to show how capitalism re-alienates this essence, splitting it into these two domains. The difference in regime between desiring and social production, paradoxically most pronounced under capitalism, enables schizoanalysis to critique social organization based on the nature of desire.

### Territorialization, Deterritorialization, Reterritorialization

<mark class="hltr-orange">‚ÄúTerritorialization‚Äù is a term derived from Lacan‚Äôs analysis of the process bywhich parental care-giving, starting with maternal breast-feeding, maps the infant‚Äôs erogenous zones, charging specific organs and corresponding objects with erotic energy and value (the lips and the breast, for example). Territorialization thusprograms desire to valorize certain organs and objects at the expense of others,and at the expense of what Freud called ‚Äúpolymorphous perversity‚Äù: the free-flowing, relatively unfixed, form of desire Deleuze and Guattari call schizophrenia.As one would expect, the schizoanalytic term ‚Äúdeterritorialization‚Äù designates, in the psychological register, the reverse of Lacanian territorialization ‚Äì that is to say, the process of freeing desire from established organs and objects: one of the principal aims of schizoanalysis, for example, is to free schizophrenic desire fromthe nuclear family and from the oedipal representations of desire promulgated by psychoanalysis. At the same time, however, Deleuze and Guattari use‚Äúdeterritorialization‚Äù ‚Äì now in the social register ‚Äì to designate the freeing of labor-power from specific means of production, as in the case of English peasants whowere banished or ‚Äúfreed‚Äù by the Enclosure Acts (1709‚Äì1869) from common land when it was enclosed for sheep-grazing. Some peasants, of course, would eventuallyfind jobs working at looms in the nascent textile industry: their labor-power wasthereby re-attached or ‚Äúreterritorialized‚Äù onto new means of production. The processes of deterritorialization and reterritorialization accompany the fundamentalmechanism of capital, ‚Äúaxiomatization‚Äù: it operates by conjoining deterritorializedresources and appropriating the surplus arising from their reterritorializing conjunction. The original capitalist axiom, for example, conjoined deterritorializedwealth ‚Äì i.e. monetary wealth no longer embodied in landed property ‚Äì withdeterritorialized labor-power bereft of any means of subsistence: the axiomatizationof these deterritorialized flows linked liquid wealth invested in means of production with ‚Äúfree‚Äù workers with nothing to sell but their labor-power. Subsequently, the continuing development of capitalism has axiomatized many other resource-flows</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92PMT)

<mark class="hltr-orange">‚Äì including knowledge, skills, and taste ‚Äì and integrated them into the productionprocess.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=33&annotation=ET4ARZLN)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The terms deterritorialization and reterritorialization thuspresuppose and reinforce the notice of a ‚Äúcommon essence‚Ä¶of desire and labor,‚Äù referring without distinction to the detachment and reattachment of the energies of‚Äúproduction in general‚Äù (including ‚Äúconsumption‚Äù) to objects of investment of allkinds, whether conventionally considered ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù or ‚Äúeconomic.‚Äù</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=33&annotation=FEM668LS)

- [N] Territorialization, Deterritorialization, reTerritorialization
- [N] Territorialization (Lacan): Parental care maps erogenous zones, fixing desire on organs/objects, reducing polymorphous perversity.
- [N] Deterritorialization (psychological): Freeing desire from established organs/objects (e.g., from family/Oedipal representations).
- [N] Deterritorialization (social): Freeing labor-power from specific means of production (e.g., peasants from land by Enclosure Acts).
- [N] Reterritorialization: Re-attaching deterritorialized flows onto new objects (e.g., peasants' labor onto factory looms).
- [N] Deterritorialization/reterritorialization accompany axiomatization in capitalism (conjoining deterritorialized wealth and labor).
- [N] Capitalism deterritorializes/reterritorializes various flows (wealth, labor, knowledge, skills, taste).
- [N] These terms imply the common essence of desire and labor ("production in general"), referring to detachment/attachment of energy to psychological/economic objects of investment.

> The concepts of territorialization, deterritorialization, and reterritorialization are applied in both psychological and social registers. Territorialization fixes desire onto specific objects (reducing polymorphous perversity), while deterritorialization frees it (psychologically, from Oedipal representations; socially, labor from means of production). Reterritorialization re-attaches these flows elsewhere. These processes are central to capitalism's axiomatization and imply the common essence of desire and labor as generalized "production" energy.

### Decoding and Recoding under Capitalism

<mark class="hltr-orange">Decoding, it is important to note, does not refer to the process of translatinga secret meaning or message into clearer form: on the contrary, it refers to a processof dis-investing given meanings altogether, to a process of ‚Äúuncoding,‚Äù if you like:the destabilization and ultimately the elimination of established codes that confer fixed meaning. If capitalism deterritorializes because of the imperative to constantlyrevolutionize production and consumption so as to generate and realize surplus-value, it decodes because it defines and measures value in terms of abstractquantities, because its basic institution is the market.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BB3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">whereas othersocieties are based on codes, on the establishment of qualitative similarities that underlie stable meanings, capitalism systematically undermines codes, replacingthem with the cash nexus of the market as the basis of social organization.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=33&annotation=4B3SDJZR)

<mark class="hltr-orange">Whatever temporary local meanings capitalism does provide through recoding are strictly derivative of the axioms that happen to be in place: job-training and retraining programs, for instance, provide certain local meanings associated withmanual labor; research projects in academic or corporate labs provide othermeanings for intellectual work; taste-management through advertising providesstill others for consumption, and so on. But they never ‚Äúadd up‚Äù to a stable global code or system of meanings: under capitalism, decoding prevails. That is why schizoanalysis takes schizophrenia ‚Äì creative semiosis unlimited by fixed meaning ‚Äì to be the fundamental tendency under capitalism and the promise of freedom in universal history, while the tendency to paranoia appears as a reaction-formationderived from the forced privatization of ‚Äúproductive activity in general,‚Äù ineconomics and family-life alike.</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92K7)

- [N] Decoding
- [N] Decoding is not translating, but dis-investing/eliminating established codes/fixed meanings ("uncoding").
- [N] Capitalism decodes because it measures value in abstract quantities (the market).
- [N] Unlike other societies based on codes/stable meanings, capitalism undermines codes, replacing them with the cash nexus.
- [N] Recoding
- [N] Capitalism provides temporary local meanings through recoding (job training, advertising) derivative of axioms.
- [N] These don't form a stable global code; decoding prevails under capitalism.
- [N] Schizoanalysis sees schizophrenia (unlimited semiosis) as the fundamental tendency under capitalism and promise of freedom.
- [N] Paranoia is a reaction-formation to forced privatization of production (in economics/family).

> Decoding, in D&G's terms, is the elimination of fixed meanings and established codes. Capitalism systematically decodes by basing social organization on the abstract quantities of the market (cash nexus), unlike other societies based on qualitative codes. While capitalism offers temporary local meanings through "recoding," decoding ultimately prevails. Schizoanalysis identifies schizophrenia (unlimited semiosis) as the primary tendency and revolutionary potential of capitalism, while paranoia is a reactive defense against the decoding process.

### Desiring-Machines, Factory Model, and Rejecting Representation

<mark class="hltr-orange">The concept of ‚Äúdesiring-machines,‚Äù finally, while serving cognitively to connect libido and labor in a single term as we have said, also serves key polemical purposes.  Foremost among these will be to replace the theater model of the psyche foundthroughout Freud with a factory model. This constitutes for one thing a rejectionof tragedy (as in Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, and so on) as an appropriate mode for the analytic endeavor: schizoanalytic therapy, were such a thing to exist, would endwith a hearty chuckle, not a rueful sigh. In any case, schizoanalysis effects a Nietzschean transvaluation of psychoanalysis by eliminating its pervasive senseof guilt and tragic resignation to defeat and death, in favor of affirmation of the forces of life. More important, Deleuze and Guattari reject representation itself ‚Äì intheatrical or any other form ‚Äì as a distortion of the real mode of operation of theunconscious, which is productive rather than expressive or representative: ‚ÄúTheunconscious poses no problems of meaning, solely problems of use. The questionposed by desire is not ‚ÄòWhat does it mean?‚Äô but ‚ÄòHow does it work?‚Äô ‚Äù(109/129)</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92R)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari consider representation to be not just a distortion</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92CT)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">of desire but the principal means of repressing desire and of betraying its authentic schizophrenic form. Even if the answer given by psychoanalysis did not endlessly revolve around the ‚ÄúOedipus complex,‚Äù the very question of ‚Äúwhat desire means‚Äù already entails a profound misunderstanding of the unconscious: whenever and however it is answered, it traps desire in repressive representations of one kind or another.</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92K)

- [N] "Desiring-machines" connect libido and labor.
- [N] They replace the psychoanalytic theater model with a factory model of the psyche.
- [N] This rejects tragedy; schizoanalysis has a Nietzschean affirmation of life, eliminating guilt/resignation.
- [N] D&G reject representation (theater, etc.) as a distortion of the unconscious.
- [N] The unconscious is productive, not expressive/representative.
- [N] The question for desire is "How does it work?", not "What does it mean?".
- [N] Representation is seen as a principal means of repressing desire.
- [N] Asking "what desire means" fundamentally misunderstands the unconscious and traps desire in repression.

> Desiring-machines serve to link libido and labor and replace the psychoanalytic theater model of the psyche with a factory model, reflecting a Nietzschean affirmation of life over tragic resignation. Crucially, D&G reject representation itself as a distortion and repressive force, arguing that the unconscious is productive, operating on questions of use ("How does it work?") rather than meaning ("What does it mean?"), as focusing on meaning traps desire in representation.

### Desire as Productive Force, Not Lack

<mark class="hltr-green">Deleuze and Guattaridraw inspiration from Nietzschean affirmation: desire, they insist, does not lack anything, does not aim at what it does not have or what is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù; it does not construct a fantasy-world containing objects of desire apart and different from the real world. On the contrary, desire is first and foremost productive force, and what it produces is simply the real world: ‚ÄúIf desire produces, its product is real. If desireis productive, it can be productive only in the real world and can produce onlyreality.... The objective being of desire is the Real in and of itself‚Äù (26‚Äì7/34).50 Only secondarily, as a result of social organizations which deprive certain people or classes of their objective being and the fruits of their labor, does productive desire become reactive and construct a parallel world of gratification (sometimes called ‚Äúfantasy,‚Äù sometimes ‚Äúheaven‚Äù) as imaginary compensation for what has beentaken from it.51 To the extent that psychoanalysis subscribes to the notion thatdesire is based on lack rather than on force, Deleuze and Guattari consider it a reactive, slave psychology; under the cloak of the psychoanalyst, as Nietzschemight say, they smell a priest.</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92SJ)

- [N] Productive, not Lack
- [N] Drawing on Nietzsche, D&G state desire is productive force, not based on lack or absence.
- [N] Desire produces reality; its product is the Real.
- [N] Desire constructs fantasy/parallel worlds only secondarily, as a reactive response to social organizations depriving people of their objective being/labor fruits (compensation for loss).
- [N] Psychoanalysis, by basing desire on lack, is seen as a reactive, "slave psychology" (Nietzschean term).

> Following Nietzschean affirmation, D&G argue that desire is fundamentally a productive force that creates reality, not a lack seeking a missing object or a fantasy world. They see the construction of compensatory fantasy worlds as a secondary, reactive outcome of social systems that deprive people. Psychoanalysis, in its focus on lack, is thus critiqued as a "slave psychology."

### Desire Produces Reality

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Forschizoanalysis, of course, it is unconscious rather than conscious ‚Äúintention‚Äù that constitutes reality. But more important, the difference between the‚Äúphenomenologically constituted‚Äù real and the ‚Äúscientific‚Äù real is strictly secondary, according to schizoanalysis: both ‚Äúversions‚Äù of reality are first of all products of desire, before distinctions between them can be drawn (distinctions which, as Nietzsche would insist, are themselves also products of a certain kind of desire!).</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92FC6C)

- [N] Unconscious intention constitutes reality in schizoanalysis.
- [N] The difference between phenomenological and scientific reality is secondary; both are products of desire.
- [N] Desire produces reality like lawyers produce evidence: they make it count as real.
- [N] Desire produces reality "in and of itself," before distinctions like inside/outside the courtroom.

> In schizoanalysis, reality is constituted by unconscious intention and is fundamentally a product of desire, preceding distinctions between phenomenological and scientific versions. Using the analogy of lawyers producing evidence, the text explains that desire makes things "count as real," producing reality itself before conventional boundaries between fact/evidence and reality, or inside/outside, are established.

### Desiring-Machines Link Desiring and Social Production

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Schizoanalysistherefore insists that while desire and labor are essentially the same productive force, they nonetheless operate under capitalism according to different regimes, which are conventionally mapped by different disciplines: political economy and psychoanalysis. Although Deleuze and Guattari show little respect for the boundaryseparating these two disciplines, they do maintain a specific difference between the regimes themselves, which they refer to as desiring-production (formerly libido)and social-production (labor). But this difference is not between fantasy and reality:‚ÄúThere is no such thing as the social production of reality on the one hand, and a desiring-production that is mere fantasy on the other‚Ä¶social production is purelyand simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions‚Äù (28‚Äì9/36).</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92LSG)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Such is precisely the effect of the lexical link Deleuze and Guattari forge between desiring-production</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92F6)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">and social-production through their use of the term desiring-machines: the normallydistinct regimes of libidinal economy and political economy, of asceticism andcapitalism, are targeted by a mode of critique that simultaneously produces pleasure and insight by showing that these economies are in fact one and the same.</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92WN)

- [N] The tendentious joke
- [N] Desire and labor are the same productive force but operate in different regimes under capitalism (mapped by psychoanalysis and political economy).
- [N] D&G refer to these regimes as desiring-production (libido) and social-production (labor).
- [N] The difference is not between fantasy and reality; social production *is* desiring-production under specific conditions.
- [N] Desiring-machines lexically link desiring-production and social-production.
- [N] Desiring-machines show the identity of libidinal economy (asceticism) and political economy (capitalism), providing critique, pleasure, and insight.

> Despite appearing as distinct regimes (psychoanalysis/libidinal economy vs. political economy/social economy) under capitalism, desire and labor are fundamentally the same productive force. Social production is simply desiring-production under specific conditions. The concept of "desiring-machines" serves as a lexical link, revealing the identity of these regimes and enabling a critique that shows how libidinal and political economies are one.

<mark class="hltr-orange">The connectivesynthesis concerns instincts and drives, and the ways they endow objects with value or erotic charge; roughly speaking, it translates Freud‚Äôs notion of libidinalinvestment or cathexis and the functions he assigns to Eros or the life instinct.The disjunctive synthesis involves the functioning of pleasure, memory, and signs in the psyche, along with what Freud called the death instinct, or Thanatos. Theconjunctive synthesis, finally, is about the formation of subjectivity.</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92L9)

- [N] Desiring-machines operate via three syntheses: connective (production), disjunctive (recording), and conjunctive (consumption-consummation).
- [N] Connective synthesis: concerns drives/instincts, valuing objects (like Freudian cathexis, Eros).
- [N] Disjunctive synthesis: involves pleasure, memory, signs, and the death instinct (Thanatos).
- [N] Conjunctive synthesis: about the formation of subjectivity.

> Desiring-machines function through three core syntheses of the unconscious: the connective synthesis of production (linking drives to objects, like Freudian cathexis), the disjunctive synthesis of recording (involving signs, memory, pleasure, and the death instinct), and the conjunctive synthesis of consumption-consummation (where subjectivity is formed).

### The connective synthesis of production


### The Connective Synthesis of Production

<mark class="hltr-orange">The connective synthesis of production is in some ways the easiest of the three to understand, deriving as it does from the Freudian notions of ‚Äúdrive,‚Äù psychic‚Äúinvestment‚Äù (investissement) or ‚Äúcathexis,‚Äù and ‚Äúpolymorphous perversity.‚ÄùProductive desire makes connections, and what it connects are part-objects (oftenbut not necessarily organs).</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92XJ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the first place, the production of such connectionscorresponds to Freudian drives and constitutes the materialist basis of the model: connections are made so as to tap into a source of energy and procure a ‚Äúcharge,‚Äù whether physiological, erotic, or both.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92E)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Second, syntheses of production connectonly what Melanie Klein termed ‚Äúpart-objects,‚Äù not whole persons or organs understood as belonging to whole persons.2 If an infant‚Äôs mouth connects to amother‚Äôs breast while at the same time its eye scans her face, the synthesis of production makes only those two connections: the breast and face are not connected to one another nor to a larger whole, are not viewed as belonging to a single whole person.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92D)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Third, the connections made by the synthesis of production are multiple, heterogeneous, and continual: an eye scans a head of hair, and then sees a face, and then a breast, and then a knee; a mouth connects to a breast, to some air, and then to a finger; a finger connects to a lock of hair, and then to a mouth, and so on.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92U)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari thus sum up the syntax of the connectivesynthesis as a series of ‚Äúand‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶‚Äù (5/11) whereby one ‚Äúorganmachine‚Äù (6/12) connects with another, and then another, and then another3 ‚Äìprovided we understand the semantics of the term ‚Äúorgan‚Äù being used here toqualify these machines in the broadest possible ‚Äúpolymorphous‚Äù way, as any partial-object which gives or gets a charge or flow of energy through a connection.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92RE)

- [N] The connective synthesis derives from Freudian drives, cathexis, and polymorphous perversity.
- [N] It is the synthesis of production, making connections.
- [N] Connections correspond to drives, tapping energy/charge (materialist basis).
- [N] It connects only part-objects (like Melanie Klein's concept), not whole persons.
- [N] Connections are multiple, heterogeneous, and continual.
- [N] The syntax is "and...and then...and then...".
- [N] "Organ-machine" is used polymorphously, meaning any partial-object getting/giving a charge.

> The connective synthesis of production, rooted in Freudian concepts like drives and cathexis, makes connections between "organ-machines" understood as polymorphous part-objects rather than whole entities. These connections are multiple, heterogeneous, and continual, driven by the need to tap into energy flows, following a logic of "and... and then... and then...".

### The disjunctive synthesis of recording


### Freud and the Mystic Writing Pad

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Freud himself, for example,found it useful to construct a model of the psyche based on the analogy with a ‚Äúmystic writing pad‚Äù; on a more general level, he suggested that drives invest (or</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92TP)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">cathect) mentally recorded images of previous objects of satisfaction whenever the organism cannot obtain the objects themselves.</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=40&annotation=BXVJ8VTU)

- [N] Freud used the mystic writing pad analogy for the psyche.
- [N] Drives cathect mentally recorded images of satisfaction when the real object is unavailable.

> The text references Freud's use of the "mystic writing pad" analogy to model the psyche, where drives invest in mental images of past satisfactions when real objects are inaccessible.

### Deleuze on Difference and Repetition

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze insists that difference andmultiplicity are the primary categories, and that identity is secondary anddependent on them, rather than the other way around. Difference and multiplicityare what is given ontologically; they then get betrayed and distorted by operations (including, notably, the Hegelian ‚Äúwork of the negative‚Äù) that result in identity.Restoring the category of difference to its rightful place of primacy in turn transforms the concept of ‚Äúrepetition,‚Äù for it is henceforth necessary to understandrepetition to involve not identity or equivalence among terms, but difference and variation. Within a materialist ontology of difference, what gets repeated is notthe same, but different.</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92W74)

- [N] Deleuze: Difference and multiplicity are primary, identity is secondary.
- [N] Difference and multiplicity are ontologically given.
- [N] Operations like the Hegelian "work of the negative" distort difference into identity.
- [N] Restoring difference transforms "repetition" into difference and variation, not identity.
- [N] In a materialist ontology of difference, repetition is of the different, not the same.

> The text outlines Deleuze's philosophy where difference and multiplicity are primary ontological categories, with identity being secondary. He argues that conventional thought often distorts difference into identity. Restoring the primacy of difference transforms the concept of repetition, defining it as the repetition of difference and variation rather than the mechanical return of the same.

### Freud on Repetition and the Death Instinct

<mark class="hltr-yellow">According to the Freud of Beyond the Pleasure Principle, the compulsion to repeat is what makes pleasurea principle of psychic life: we take pleasure in what we have previously found to be pleasurable. Yet since Freud‚Äôs repetition compulsion is grounded in a death instinct that stipulates a ‚Äúreturn to the inorganic state‚Äù of matter before life began,it is ultimately governed by identity, by a mechanical return to the same, ratherthan by difference. Freud‚Äôs instincts are therefore, as he himself put it, ‚Äúinnatelyconservative‚Äù; even the pleasure principle, on this understanding of repetition</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92H27)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">succumbs to stasis, fixation, neurosis.</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=41&annotation=CP5HFS6G)

- [N] Freud's repetition compulsion makes pleasure a psychic principle (pleasure in repetition of the pleasurable).
- [N] Freud's repetition compulsion is grounded in the death instinct (return to inorganic state).
- [N] This death instinct governs repetition by identity, a mechanical return to the same.
- [N] Freud's instincts are "innately conservative".
- [N] This understanding of repetition leads to stasis, fixation, and neurosis.

> The text describes Freud's concept of the repetition compulsion from *Beyond the Pleasure Principle*, where repetition is linked to pleasure. However, grounded in the death instinct's aim for a return to the inorganic state, this repetition is characterized by a mechanical return to the same, leading to conservative instincts, stasis, fixation, and neurosis.

#on/freud #on/repetition #on/death-instinct


### Repetition of Difference vs Repetition of the Same

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Restoring difference to repetition does not diminish the importance of repetition in psychic life as the principle of pleasure,but frees pleasure from mechanical repetition and a strictly linear temporality: whereas repetition of the same constitutes a static neurotic form of pleasure fixed on the past, the repetition of difference takes pleasure in variation, ramification, improvisation (as these are achieved by the exercise of active force).</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92F)

- [N] Restoring difference to repetition maintains repetition's importance for pleasure.
- [N] It frees pleasure from mechanical repetition and linear time.
- [N] Repetition of the same is static, neurotic, past-fixed pleasure.
- [N] Repetition of difference takes pleasure in variation, improvisation (exercise of active force).

> By introducing difference into the concept of repetition, pleasure is freed from the static, neurotic repetition of the same (fixed on the past). Instead, the repetition of difference allows for pleasure in variation, ramification, and improvisation, linked to the exercise of active force.

### Anti-Production (D&G's Death Instinct) and the Body-Without-Organs (BwO)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We can now return to the schizoanalytic syntheses of desire, for taking pleasurein variation and ramification rather than in mechanical repetition requires acomplementary counter-force to the connective synthesis, which would otherwise lock the organism into instinctual or habitual patterns of connection. Such a counter-force would allow a given set of organ‚Äìmachine connections to be broken and other connections made in their place, only to be broken in their turn and replaced with others, and so on ad infinitum.</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92U)

<mark class="hltr-blue">Desiring-machines [operating by connective synthesis] make us anorganism; but at the very heart of production, within the very production of this production [of organ-machine connections], the body suffers from being organized in this way, from not having some other organization, or no organization at all....The [machines] stop dead and set free the unorganized mass [of energy-flows] they once served to articulate.(8/14)</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92QM)

<mark class="hltr-green">This is the role of Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs version of the death instinct: to bring productive desire to a halt, to suspend or freeze the connections it has made, in order that new and different connections may become possible; they thereforeprefer the term ‚Äúanti-production‚Äù to ‚Äúdeath instinct‚Äù</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=41&annotation=S44JAXYZ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The effect of anti-production on the connective syntheses, then, is to desexualize desire by neutralizing the organ-machine connections, and thereby constitute a surface that records networks of relations among connections, instead of producing connections themselves: it is this recording-surface that Deleuze and Guattari refer to as the body-without-organs.</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92R)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It should now be clearer why they resort to this obscure term borrowed from Artaud: it is used to raise the question of how the body is organ-ized, and how itmight be actively dis-organ-ized so as to enable the production of other forms of organ-ization ‚Äì or no fixed organ-ization at all, which is the state they designate as schizophrenia.</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92KII)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Schizoanalysis construes the body as an assemblage of ‚Äúorgans‚Äù in the broadest sense of the term, including not just sex and sense organs, but allparts of the body that either focalize sensations and feelings of pleasure or pain,or perform actions of use or expenditure: the tongue as organ of taste but also as</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN9257)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">organ of speech and song; the opposable thumb as organ for grasping an ax but also for operating a track-ball or signaling someone‚Äôs death. Yet along with its organ-ization of organs, the body as schizoanalysis construes it also has a force and a locus of dis-organ-ization ‚Äì anti-production and the body-without-organs‚Äì which can prevent any given organ-ization from becoming permanently fixed,10Whether fixed organ-ization or radical dis-organ-ization is likely to prevail dependsultimately on the mode of social-production and one‚Äôs place in or stance towardit</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92YY)

- [N] Taking pleasure in variation requires a counter-force to the connective synthesis's tendency to lock in patterns.
- [N] This counter-force allows connections to be broken and new ones made endlessly.
- [N] Desiring-machines organize the body, but the body also suffers from this organization and has a force to resist it.
- [N] This counter-force brings production to a halt, freeing unorganized energy.
- [N] D&G's version of the death instinct is this force: "anti-production".
- [N] Anti-production suspends connections to make new/different ones possible. They prefer "anti-production" to "death instinct".
- [N] Anti-production desexualizes desire by neutralizing connections.
- [N] It constitutes a surface that records relations among connections: the body-without-organs (BwO).
- [N] The BwO is used to question how the body is organized and how it can be dis-organized.
- [N] Dis-organization enables other forms of organization, or none (schizophrenia).
- [N] The BwO
- [N] Body is an assemblage of "organs" (broadly defined: pleasure/pain focal points, action performers).
- [N] The body also has a force of dis-organization (anti-production, BwO) preventing permanent organ-ization.
- [N] Whether fixed organization or radical dis-organization prevails depends on the mode of social-production.

> To enable pleasure in variation, a counter-force is needed against the connective synthesis's tendency towards fixed patterns. This force, which D&G call "anti-production" (their version of the death instinct), halts productive connections to make new ones possible. Anti-production neutralizes connections, creating a recording surface called the body-without-organs (BwO). The BwO is the body's force of dis-organization, preventing fixed organization and enabling the fluid state of schizophrenia. Schizoanalysis sees the body as an assemblage of broadly defined organs, with the BwO as the potential for radical dis-organization depending on the social context.

### BwO, Memory, and Synchronic Time

<mark class="hltr-green">The formation of the body-without-organs opens or subjects animal instinctto the distinctively human form of time: to memory and to repetition. What registerson the body-without-organs are essentially signs of organ‚Äìmachine connections that enable or oblige us to repeat previous modes of desiring-satisfaction, albeitwith greater or lesser degrees of freedom of variation within repetition. Forming a system of relations, these signs bind or synthesize time, enabling us to relate or compare one satisfaction to another, and to take pleasure not necessarily in experiencing the new in terms of the old (as Freud would have it) but simply in experiencing one thing in relation to something else, instead. For inasmuch as the signs comprise a ‚Äúsystem of possible permutations among differences‚Äù (12/18; translation modified) on the body-without-organs, they bind time synchronically,as Lacan (following Saussure) might put it, rather than linearly</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BQ)

- [N] BwO formation subjects instinct to human time (memory, repetition).
- [N] BwO registers signs of connections, enabling/obliging repetition of satisfactions (with variation).
- [N] Signs form a system of relations on the BwO, binding/synthesizing time.
- [N] This enables relating/comparing satisfactions and taking pleasure in relations (not just new-in-terms-of-old).
- [N] Signs on the BwO form a system of permutations among differences.
- [N] Signs bind time synchronically (like Lacan/Saussure), not linearly.

> The body-without-organs introduces memory and repetition, opening instinct to human time. It registers signs of past connections, facilitating repetition with variation. These signs form a system of relations on the BwO, binding time synchronically and enabling pleasure in relating different experiences rather than just linearly repeating the past.

### D&G's Qualifications to Lacan's Unconscious as Code

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari credit Lacan with ‚Äúthe discovery of this fertiledomain of a code of the unconscious‚Äù (38/46), i.e. an unconscious comprised ofsigns forming a synchronic differential system. But they insist on several qualifications to this discovery. For one thing, the system of relations formed on the body-without-organs is not linear, does not sponsor what Lacan calls the‚Äúmetonymy of desire,‚Äù a vain search for some lost object from the past;12 it operates instead by a radically indeterminate mode of ‚Äúfree association‚Äù among signs. Theythus do not, for another, form a single ‚Äúsignifying chain,‚Äù as Lacan would have it,but many: sign-relations on the body-without-organs form ‚Äúa multiplicity so complex that we can scarcely speak of one chain or even of one code of desire‚Äù (38/46). Finally, not only are these signs not meaningful (as Lacan would ultimatelyagree), they do not even belong to one sign-system (as Lacan claims they do: theunconscious as language-system); instead they are radically heterogeneous, andthus</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92AL7)

<mark class="hltr-green">Synchronic rather than linear or metonymic, multiple rather than singular,heterogeneous and polyvocal rather than univocal and meaningful, ‚Äúthe one vocation of the sign is to produce desire, engineering it in every direction‚Äù (39/47).</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92I9)

- [N] D&G credit Lacan for discovering the unconscious as a code (synchronic differential system).
- [N] Qualifications to Lacan: The BwO system is not linear ("metonymy of desire") but indeterminate free association.
- [N] It's not a single signifying chain, but multiple chains/codes (complex multiplicity).
- [N] Signs are not meaningful (Lacan eventually agreed).
- [N] Signs don't belong to one system (language), but are heterogeneous (mix of alphabets, images, etc.).
- [N] Quote illustrating heterogeneous signs.
- [N] Signs are synchronic, multiple, heterogeneous, polyvocal, and their function is to produce desire in every direction.

> While crediting Lacan for seeing the unconscious as a code-like, synchronic system, D&G offer several qualifications. They argue the BwO system is not linear or a single chain but a complex multiplicity of heterogeneous signs (not just linguistic, including images, etc.). These signs are not meaningful in themselves but function to produce desire in multiple directions via free association.

### Lacan on Repression, the Unary Trait, and Lost Drives

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Repression, in Lacan‚Äôs view,is based on this incompatibility between the substantial nature of the body and bodily drives, on the one hand, and the differential nature of language as signifyingsystem and of consciousness, on the other: being and meaning do not interfaceor converge; human language fails to represent the human body.</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92N)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The unary trait henceforth serves as a kind of magnet of lost substantiality, drawing all subsequently repressed material into the unconscious where it formsits own matrix of differential relations: the unconscious is now structured like a</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92HY)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">language, with a constantly shifting, idiosyncratic set of ‚Äúmeanings‚Äù all its own.</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=44&annotation=JXR9S6AI)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But for the existentialist psychoanalyst, such meanings are radically groundless and ultimately illusory: as a kind of screen separating differential meaning from bodily substance, the meaningless unary trait blocks access to the body and its drives, which are thus forever tragically ‚Äúlost‚Äù to consciousness.</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92TS4)

- [N] Lacan: Repression is based on the incompatibility between bodily substance (being) and language/signification (meaning).
- [N] Human language fails to represent the body.
- [N] The unary trait (a meaningless mark) attracts repressed material into the unconscious.
- [N] The unconscious becomes structured like a language with differential relations and idiosyncratic "meanings".
- [N] For existentialist psychoanalysis, these meanings are groundless/illusory.
- [N] The unary trait acts as a screen, blocking access to bodily drives, which are tragically lost to consciousness.

> The text describes Lacan's view of repression as stemming from an incompatibility between the body's substantiality and language's differential nature. The unary trait, a meaningless mark, acts as a screen, attracting repressed material and structuring the unconscious like a language, but ultimately blocking access to bodily drives, which remain tragically inaccessible.

### D&G vs Lacan on the Body-Without-Organs and Signification

<mark class="hltr-magenta">For Deleuzeand Guattari, the body-without-organs functions, like the unary trait, as such a screen between the body and consciousness, but with several differences. For one thing, the sign-system constituted on the body-without-organs is not exclusively linguistic, and therefore not purely differential in the sense that Saussure insisted phonetic language is. Moreover, given Deleuze‚Äôs understandingof the repetition compulsion within his materialist ontology, bodily drives are themselves already differential as well as substantial (and, given Deleuze andGuattari‚Äôs materialist semiotics, we might add, systems of representation are equallysubstantial as well as differential). So there is for schizoanalysis no absolute, tragic incompatibility between the body and processes of signification. Instead, therelative compatibility or incompatibility of desire with any historically given system of representation depends on the degree to which that system contravenes or agrees with the modes of operation intrinsic to desire (i.e. operates according toillegitimate or legitimate use of the syntheses).</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92M)

- [N] Need clarification on this
  - [N] D&G's BwO, like Lacan's unary trait, acts as a screen between body and consciousness, but with key differences.
  - [N] Unlike the unary trait's purely linguistic system, the BwO's sign system is not exclusively linguistic (it's heterogeneous).
  - [N] Unlike Lacan's fundamental split between body substance and language difference, D&G's materialist ontology sees bodily drives as *already* both differential and substantial. Systems of representation are also both substantial and differential.
  - [N] Therefore, for D&G, there is no *absolute* tragic incompatibility between the body and signification.
  - [N] Compatibility depends on whether the system of representation aligns with the inherent processes (syntheses) of desire.

> This highlight explains how D&G's concept of the Body-Without-Organs compares to Lacan's unary trait. Both act as a screen between the body and consciousness. However, D&G's BwO involves a heterogeneous sign-system (not just linguistic), and in their materialist ontology, bodily drives are seen as both substantial and differential from the start. This means D&G do not see an absolute, tragic incompatibility between the body and signification, unlike Lacan. Instead, compatibility depends on how well a given system of representation aligns with the inherent operations of desire's syntheses.

### BwO as Potential for Freedom

<mark class="hltr-green">For now what is important is thatthe body-without-organs represents for schizoanalysis not just the locus of repression but the potential for freedom. It can be compared to a kind of tabula rasa, freeing the organism from the purely mechanical repetition of instinctual determination as well as the fixations of neurosis ‚Äì provided we understand that such a tabula rasa does not exist from the start, but rather gets produced in the course of psychic development by the transformation of energies of connection into energies of recording.</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92PQ)

- [N] The BwO is a locus of repression AND potential for freedom.
- [N] It is like a tabula rasa, freeing from instinctual repetition and neurotic fixations.
- [N] The BwO is not innate but produced by transforming connective energy into recording energy during psychic development.

> The Body-Without-Organs is presented as both a site of repression and, more importantly, a potential for freedom. Acting like a tabula rasa, it liberates the organism from rigid instinctual repetition and neurotic fixations. This BwO is not a given but is actively produced psychically by transforming the energy of connection into the energy of recording.

### BwO States: Barrier vs Network

<mark class="hltr-blue">When anti-production predominates, ‚Äúthe body without organs presents its smooth, slippery,opaque, taut surface as a barrier‚Ä¶in order to resist organ‚Äìmachines‚Äù (9/15). When productive desire prevails, machines ‚Äúattach themselves to the body-without-organs as so many points of disjunction, between which an entire network of new syntheses is now woven, marking the surface off into co-ordinates, like a grid‚Äù (12/18).</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92J59)

- [N] When anti-production prevails, the BwO is a barrier resisting organ-machines.
- [N] When productive desire prevails, machines attach to the BwO as points of disjunction.
- [N] This attachment weaves a network of new syntheses on the BwO surface (like a grid).

> Depending on whether anti-production or productive desire predominates, the Body-Without-Organs appears in different states: either as a smooth, resistant barrier against organ-machines (anti-production prevailing) or as a surface onto which machines attach as points of disjunction, weaving a network of new connections (productive desire prevailing).

### Disjunctive Synthesis Syntax and Multiplication of Possibilities

<mark class="hltr-green">What is essential is that even while anti-production interrupts or suspendsexisting productive connections on the body-without-organs, it at the same time registers their diverse possibilities, and ends up multiplying the relations among them to infinity. Hence the importance of the syntax of the disjunctive synthesisof recording, which selects and networks signs of organ‚Äìmachines produced by</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN925E)

<mark class="hltr-green">connective syntheses in a strictly open-ended series: ‚Äúeither‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶or....‚Äù</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92S)

- [N] Anti-production interrupts connections but registers their possibilities on the BwO.
- [N] This multiplies relations among possibilities infinitely.
- [N] The disjunctive synthesis of recording selects and networks signs.
- [N] Its syntax is the open-ended series: "either...or...or....".

> The disjunctive synthesis of recording, facilitated by anti-production on the Body-Without-Organs, is crucial because it not only interrupts existing connections but registers and multiplies their diverse possibilities. This synthesis operates via an open-ended "either...or...or..." syntax, networking signs of potential organ-machine connections.

### D&G vs Freud/Lacan on the Emergence of Recording and Examples

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Unlike Freud, for whom a recording-apparatus emerges in the psyche becauseinfantile desire hampered by lack of motor control is unable to obtain the realobject of gratification and therefore invests (‚Äúhallucinatory‚Äù) images of satisfaction instead; and unlike Lacan, for whom the recording-function of the unconsciousis based on the unary trait which radically separates bodily drives fromconsciousness, Deleuze and Guattari see disjunctive synthesis on the bodywithout-organs first emerging as a transformation of connective energy itself, at the point when an identity between the process of desiring-production and afinished product has been achieved.</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92A5)

<mark class="hltr-blue">The connection between mouth and breast,for example, gets broken when it has finished producing its ‚Äúproduct,‚Äù which is nourishment or satisfaction: as the connection gives way to disjunction, it registers on the body-without-organs as a sign of satisfaction, and the infant rejects the breast and turns away. The mouth is now freed from the breast, and may lapse into quiescence or become some other organ altogether: an organ for expellinginstead of ingesting liquid, for example, if the infant proceeds to burp or vomit; oran organ for smiling; or an organ for expelling a flow of air instead of liquid, if the child sighs happily, or starts to cry or coo or babble.  More significantly, the infant may pull away from the breast for other reasons,without any ultimate physiological satisfaction having been achieved. Perhaps a smile catches its eye, and it suspends the mouth‚Äìbreast connection to pursue an eye‚Äìface connection instead ‚Äì and then maybe looks away and brings a finger into connection with a lock of hair: in each case the disjunctive energy of anti-production functions to suspend one organ-machine connection, but only for the sake of another, in an open-ended series: either mouth‚Äìbreast, or eye‚Äìsmile, or finger‚Äìhair, or whatever.</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92L6)

- [N] D&G differ from Freud/Lacan on how recording emerges.
- [N] Freud: Recording emerges due to lack of real object, investment in images.
- [N] Lacan: Recording based on unary trait separating body/consciousness.
- [N] D&G: Disjunctive synthesis/recording emerges from transformation of *connective* energy when production process achieves a product.
- [N] Example: Mouth-breast connection broken when nourishment (product) is achieved; registers as sign of satisfaction on BwO.
- [N] Infant rejects breast, mouth freed for other uses (expelling, smiling, babbling).
- [N] Disjunction can also occur *without* satisfaction, suspending one connection for another (eye-smile, finger-hair).
- [N] This illustrates anti-production suspending one connection for another in an "either...or..." series.

> The text contrasts D&G's view on the emergence of the disjunctive synthesis/recording with Freud and Lacan. For D&G, it arises from the transformation of connective energy upon achieving a "product," not from lack (Freud) or the unary trait (Lacan). Examples like an infant rejecting the breast after feeding or turning to another object show how disjunction suspends connections, registering signs on the BwO and freeing organs for different uses in an open-ended "either/or" series.

### BwO Frees from Instinctual Determination

<mark class="hltr-green">The body-without-organs is thus ultimately what freesthe human animal from instinctual determination, for it prevents us from remainingfixated on any (developmentally or historically) given mode of satisfaction. What possibilities would exist for the development of culinary arts, for instance, ifhumans remained exclusively fixated on the breast for nourishment, or for oral gratification? The senses and organs can operate productively (in the broadest sense: creatively; as ‚Äútheoreticians in their immediate praxis,‚Äù as Marx put it16) only on condition that they are freed from pre-established or instinctual connections and modes of satisfaction ‚Äì and that is one effect of anti-production: to produce the body-without-organs as a kind of tabula rasa on which objects ofdrives and instincts register so as to multiply and differentiate.</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92L)

- [N] The BwO is what frees humans from instinctual determination.
- [N] It prevents fixation on given modes of satisfaction.
- [N] Example: Culinary arts wouldn't exist if humans fixated on the breast.
- [N] Organs/senses can be productive/creative only if freed from pre-established connections/satisfactions.
- [N] Anti-production produces the BwO as a tabula rasa where drive/instinct objects register, allowing them to multiply/differentiate.

> Ultimately, the Body-Without-Organs is presented as the key to human freedom from instinctual determination. By preventing fixation on pre-established modes of satisfaction, it allows senses and organs to operate creatively. This liberation is an effect of anti-production, which creates the BwO as a surface for diversifying possibilities, much like a tabula rasa for the objects of drives and instincts.

### Pathologies: Fixation, Breakdown, and Catatonia

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Just as the connective energy of desiring-production can succumb to fixation, the disjunctive or repulsive energy of anti-production can lead to total breakdown.If productive connections are systematically broken or denied by others, suchdenial can subsequently be ‚Äúinternalized‚Äù via repression, taken up and reproduced</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92M)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">autonomously by the force of anti-production operating consistently against the organism‚Äôs own connective syntheses: the temporary deferral of gratification associated with self-mastery and the enhancement of active force can becomethe absolute refusal of gratification characteristic of neurosis and self-denial.</mark> [Page 46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92Q8)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Taken tothe extreme, anti-production can prevent the formation of any organ-machineconnections whatsoever, thereby bringing about complete withdrawal onto what Deleuze and Guattari sometimes call the ‚Äúfull‚Äù body-without-organs: this is the condition known in psychiatry as catatonia ‚Äì a condition which Deleuze and Guattari suggest is usually the result of capitalist society‚Äôs violent refusal tocountenance the process of schizophrenia fostered by capitalism itself.</mark> [Page 46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92LR)

- [N] Connective energy can lead to fixation; anti-production energy can lead to breakdown.
- [N] Denial of productive connections by others can be internalized as repression.
- [N] Internalized repression leads anti-production to operate against connective syntheses.
- [N] Temporary deferral (self-mastery) can become absolute refusal (neurosis, self-denial).
- [N] Extreme anti-production prevents all connections, leading to withdrawal onto the "full" BwO.
- [N] This state is catatonia.
- [N] Catatonia is often a result of capitalist society's refusal of the schizophrenia process it fosters.

> The text explores pathological outcomes of the syntheses. Just as connective energy can lead to fixation, excessive anti-production can lead to breakdown. If productive connections are systematically denied externally, this can be internalized, causing anti-production to turn against the organism's own connections, leading from temporary deferral to neurotic refusal. At its extreme, anti-production results in catatonia ‚Äì a complete withdrawal onto the "full" BwO, often seen as a consequence of capitalism's violent rejection of its own generated schizophrenic process.

### The conjunctive synthesis of consumption‚Äìconsummation

### Subjectivity Emerges Post-Selection

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When production and anti-production conflict systematically, two specific forms of subjectivity result whichare noteworthy, in part because Freud had already identified them as corollariesof one another: the neurotic and the pervert.19 In the neurotic, the forces of antiproduction prevail: desiring-production is denied one or more of its own connections and is constrained to fix instead on a relatively ungratifying substituteconnection (the neurotic symptom). In the pervert, the forces of production prevail:an unorthodox organ-connection is maintained despite (or, in some cases, becauseof) social sanctions against it.</mark> [Page 46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92VJ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the subjects ofneurosis and perversion are noteworthy because they illustrate in dramatic orexaggerated form the relation of the third synthesis, the conjunctive synthesis ofconsumption‚Äìconsummation, to the interplay of production and anti-productioncomprising the first two: the subject emerges only as an after-effect of theselections made by desire among various disjunctive and connective syntheses,not as the agent of selection.</mark> [Page 46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN929Q)

- [N] Systematic conflict of production and anti-production results in neurotic (anti-production prevails, fixation on substitute) and pervert (production prevails, unorthodox connection maintained) subjectivities.
- [N] These subjects illustrate the relation of the conjunctive synthesis (3rd) to the first two (production/anti-production).
- [N] The subject emerges *after* and as an after-effect of the selections made by desire among connective/disjunctive syntheses.
- [N] The subject is not the *agent* of selection.

> The text discusses how the conflict between production and anti-production forces gives rise to specific subjectivities like the neurotic and the pervert. These forms illustrate a key point about the third, conjunctive synthesis: subjectivity emerges only as an after-effect of the choices made by desire across the first two syntheses, rather than the subject being the initiating agent of these selections.

### Illusion of Sovereign Subjectivity

<mark class="hltr-blue">when the infant rejectsthe breast and turns away to smile at a familiar face, this act is not chosen by but constitutes the infant as a subject (as ‚Äúa snacker,‚Äù ‚Äúan extrovert,‚Äù or whatever).‚ÄúNormal‚Äù adults, by contrast, typically indulge in the illusion ‚Äì the metaphysics</mark> [Page 46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92E6)

<mark class="hltr-blue">of sovereign subjectivity ‚Äì whereby they choose their pleasures and desires, rather than being ‚Äúchosen,‚Äù that is to say constituted, by them; Deleuze and Guattaridraw directly on Nietzsche to dispel this illusion and insist that the productionsand anti-productions of desire, like ‚Äúwill-to-power,‚Äù always come first, and the appearance of the subject afterward.</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92Z)


- [N] An infant's act (e.g., rejecting breast for a smile) constitutes the subject; it is not chosen by a pre-existing subject.
- [N] "Normal" adults have the illusion of sovereign subjectivity, believing they choose desires.
- [N] D&G (following Nietzsche) dispel this illusion, stating that desire's productions/anti-productions (like will-to-power) come first, and the subject appears afterward (is constituted by them).

> Using the example of an infant's actions constituting its subjectivity, the text highlights how "normal" adults live under the illusion of sovereign subjectivity, believing they are the agents of their desires. Drawing on Nietzsche, D&G counter this, asserting that the productive and anti-productive forces of desire precede and constitute the subject, rather than the subject originating desire.

### Retrospective Subject Recognition and Consummation

<mark class="hltr-green">The subject‚Äôs recognition of ‚Äúits‚Äù desire, indeed even of itself as subject, isthus crucially retrospective; hence the syntax of the conjunctive synthesis, withits use of the past tense: ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what that was!‚Äù; ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what felt sointense!‚Äù; or ‚ÄúOh! that was me!‚Äù</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92FA)

<mark class="hltr-green">The contents of such moments of‚Äúconsummation,‚Äù moreover, are derived from the connections and disjunctions generated by the previous syntheses. ‚ÄúJust as a part of the‚Ä¶energy of production was transformed into energy of recording,‚Ä¶a part of this energy of recording is transformed into energy of consummation‚Äù (16‚Äì17/23), and a subject emergesalongside the desiring-machines to ‚Äúconsume,‚Äù to enjoy or suffer, part of what has been produced.</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN927)

- [N] Subject's recognition of desire and self is retrospective (apr√®s coup).
- [N] Conjunctive synthesis syntax uses the past tense ("So that's what that was!").
- [N] Consummation contents come from connections/disjunctions of previous syntheses.
- [N] Energy is transformed from production -> recording -> consummation.
- [N] A subject emerges alongside machines to consume/experience what has been produced.

> The conjunctive synthesis involves the subject's retrospective recognition of desire and self ("apr√®s coup"), reflected in its use of the past tense. The moments of "consummation" draw content from the connections and disjunctions of the preceding syntheses, with the subject emerging alongside the desiring-machines to experience the results of this production process.

### Subject's Misrecognition and Claim of Ownership

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is thus a significantambiguity in the other formulation Deleuze and Guattari give for the conjunctive synthesis: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, and so it‚Äôs mine‚Äù (16/23). Here the subject in fact only arises in the consuming appropriation and consummating recognition of the results ofdesiring-production, yet it tends to construe itself as an autonomous entity capableof taking possession of products of the processes that in fact constitute it. The recognition that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre me!‚Äù (in the sense that my self derives from them) succumbs to the claim that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre mine!‚Äù (they belong to me).</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92BF?page=47&annotation=3WPLZYTT)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This reversal of the relation between process and product, which is crucial tosuch misrecognition (m√©connaissance) on the part of the subject and conducive to the illusion of sovereign subjectivity, is made possible by the earlier process/ product reversal of the disjunctive synthesis, whereby only results of thesuspension of the process of connective synthesis register on the body-withoutorgans ‚Äì as differences among ‚Äúfinished‚Äù products. At this point, what is merely a recording-surface henceforth appears to be the source of what getsrecognized in the constitution of the subject in conjunctive syntheses. Finally, the subject in turn claims mastery or ownership of the body-without-organs ‚Äì orof its products: consummate experience, intensities ‚Äì when it is in fact merely derivative of them. The subject as product claims as its own the very process thatconstitutes it as subject</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92JF3)

- [N] The misrecognition of the subject, taking ownership of the BwO which in fact is what constitutes it as a subject.
- [N] The conjunctive synthesis formulation "It's me, and so it's mine" highlights ambiguity.
- [N] Subject arises from consuming/recognizing desiring-production results but sees itself as autonomous.
- [N] Recognition ("they're me") shifts to claim of ownership ("they're mine").
- [N] This misrecognition (m√©connaissance) relies on a process/product reversal.
- [N] Disjunctive synthesis registers *results* (differences among "finished" products) on the BwO.
- [N] The BwO appears as the *source* of what is recognized in conjunctive synthesis.
- [N] The subject claims mastery/ownership of the BwO/its products (intensities) but is derivative of them.
- [N] The subject, as a product, claims ownership of the process that constitutes it.

> The text explores the subject's misrecognition (m√©connaissance) in the conjunctive synthesis. The subject emerges from experiencing the results of desiring-production but mistakenly sees itself as an autonomous agent ("It's me, and so it's mine"). This illusion is facilitated by the disjunctive synthesis registering results on the BwO, making the BwO appear as the source of the subject's experience. The subject then claims ownership of the BwO and its intensities, despite being a product of the very processes it seeks to master.

### The Conjunctive Synthesis and the Nomadic Subject

<mark class="hltr-green">Just as much as theconnective synthesis is continual (and‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶), and the disjunctive synthesis of recording is open-ended (either‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶), the conjunctive synthesis in turn generates, from the latter‚Äôs vast networks of relations among organ‚Äìmachines on the body-without-organs, an indefinite series of constellations orstates of intense experience, each of which gets recognized and consummated ex post facto (or apr√®s coup, in Lacan‚Äôs phrase) by a subject of that experience. Andif this subject has</mark> [Page 48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN926C)

<mark class="hltr-blue">no specific or personal identity, if it traverses the body-without-organswithout destroying [the latter‚Äôs] indifference [to any subjectivity], this isbecause it is not only a part that is peripheral to the machine, but also a part that is itself divided into parts that correspond to [the connective anddisjunctive syntheses] brought about by the machine. Thus the subjectconsumes and consummates each of the states through which it passes,and is born of each of them anew‚Ä¶(41/49; translation modified)</mark> [Page 48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92V)

- [N] Connective syntax is "and...and...", disjunctive is "either...or...".
- [N] Conjunctive synthesis generates indefinite series of intense states from the BwO's networks.
- [N] Each state is recognized/consummated apr√®s coup by a subject.
- [N] If the subject has no specific identity and respects the BwO's indifference, it is because it is peripheral and divided like the syntheses.
- [N] The subject consumes/consummates each state and is continually reborn of them.

> Just as the other syntheses have their structures (connective: "and...and...", disjunctive: "either...or..."), the conjunctive synthesis generates a series of intense experiences from the BwO's networks. A subject emerges to recognize and consume these states retrospectively. This subject, potentially without a fixed identity, is reborn with each state it experiences, mirroring the processes of the desiring-machines themselves.

### Subjective States: Catatonia, Paranoia, Schizo

<mark class="hltr-green">Deleuze and Guattari designate catatonia as the state of zero intensity: total breakdown; the synthesesextinguished completely: no connections, no recording, no subject.22 It forms a kind of base-line against which to measure the forces of attraction and repulsion operating on the active body-without-organs. The paranoiac experiences the entire panoply of desiring-machines as threatening and wants to repel them, but withoutlosing touch with them altogether (as the catatonic does). Here the forces of repulsion predominate, yet the forces of attraction are still in play: constantly repelling the desiring-machines, with no prospect of ever completely succeeding, is itself a form of intensity, especially compared to the zero-degree intensity ofthe full body-without-organs. The schizo, by contrast, affirms the forces of bothattraction and repulsion, and takes them to the limit. Instead of being repelled or</mark> [Page 48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92U)

<mark class="hltr-green">merely having their finished products registered, the connective syntheses are brought back into play and put into operation on a body-without-organs whose disjunctive syntheses multiply their ramifications indefinitely, thereby fueling theconsummation of a perpetually renewed ‚Äúnomadic‚Äù subject always different from itself, a kind of ‚Äúpermanent revolution‚Äù of psychic life.</mark> [Page 49](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92Z)

<mark class="hltr-blue">To sum up their view ofschizophrenia as a process and of the subject that results from it, Deleuze and Guattari say thatthe proportions of attraction and repulsion on the body-without-organsproduce, starting from zero, a series of states‚Ä¶and the subject is born ofeach state in the series, is continually reborn of the following state thatdetermines him at a given moment, consuming‚Äìconsummating all thesestates that cause him to be born and reborn (the lived state coming first, in relation to the subject that lives it).  (20/27)</mark> [Page 49](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92P)

- [N] Catatonia: zero intensity, total breakdown, syntheses extinguished, full BwO. Base-line for attraction/repulsion on BwO.
- [N] Paranoia: repulsion predominates, sees machines as threatening, repels but doesn't lose touch. A form of intensity.
- [N] Schizo: affirms both attraction and repulsion, takes them to the limit.
- [N] Schizo: Connective syntheses put back into play on BwO.
- [N] Schizo: Disjunctive syntheses multiply ramifications indefinitely.
- [N] This fuels a perpetually renewed, "nomadic" subject, always different.
- [N] This is a "permanent revolution" of psychic life.
- [N] D&G summarize schizophrenia as a process producing a subject from a series of states.
- [N] The subject is born/reborn of each state, consuming them.
- [N] The lived state comes first, then the subject experiencing it.

> The text outlines different subjective states based on the forces operating on the Body-Without-Organs. Catatonia is zero intensity, total breakdown. Paranoia involves predominant repulsion of desiring-machines but maintains intensity. The schizo affirms both attraction and repulsion, taking them to the limit. This state involves productive syntheses on the BwO, indefinite multiplication of possibilities, fueling a perpetually renewed "nomadic" subject in a process of "permanent revolution" of psychic life. The subject emerges from these states, constantly reborn.

### The Conjunctive Synthesis Produces Subjectivity Without Fixed Identity

<mark class="hltr-green">The conjunctive synthesis of consumption‚Äìconsummation thus does produce ‚Äúa‚Äù subject ‚Äì or rather ‚Äúsome‚Äù subjectivity: series of lived subject-states ‚Äì but without necessarily culminating in a fixed subject possessed of a specific identity.</mark> [Page 49](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5GN92A)

- [N] The conjunctive synthesis produces subjectivity as a series of lived states.
- [N] It does not necessarily result in a fixed subject with a specific identity.

> The conjunctive synthesis of consumption-consummation generates subjectivity not as a fixed, unified identity, but as a series of transient, lived subject-states.
