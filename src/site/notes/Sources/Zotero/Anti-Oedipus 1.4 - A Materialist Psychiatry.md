> **Abstract**: This section introduces Deleuze and Guattari's materialist psychiatry, which focuses on the production of desire and integrates it with social production. They critique traditional psychiatric approaches (Kraepelin, Bleuler, Binswanger) for centering on the ego and psychoanalysis (Freud) for reducing desire to the Oedipal complex and representation rather than production. They argue that desiring-machines and technical/social machines, though different in r√©gime, are aspects of the single production of the real. Capitalism is distinguished by its tendency to decode and deterritorialize flows, pushing towards a schizophrenic limit, while simultaneously counteracting this by imposing artificial reterritorialities. Neurosis, perversion, and schizophrenia are characterized by their relationships to these modern territorialities, with schizophrenia representing desiring-production at the limit of social production, reflecting capitalism's inherent contradictions.

> [!tldr]- Hypothesis
> **Hypothesis**:: Schizophrenia, understood as the process of desiring-production pushing the limits of social production, is a characteristic outcome of capitalism's inherent tendency to decode and deterritorialize flows while simultaneously attempting to recode them through artificial territorialities.

> [!summary]- Summary of Key Points
> -   A materialist psychiatry integrates desire into the mechanisms of the unconscious and production into desire, contrasting with approaches that isolate these elements.
> -   Traditional psychiatric theories of schizophrenia (Kraepelin, Bleuler, Binswanger) focus on the ego and an underlying self, which Deleuze and Guattari critique for ignoring sociohistorical conditions and the schizophrenic's state beyond the ego.
> -   Psychoanalysis initially discovered the production of desire but became limited by the Oedipus complex, substituting a theatrical representation for the unconscious as a productive factory.
> -   Understanding schizophrenia solely through the ego or material process is insufficient; it is fundamentally the process of desiring-production itself, tied to material economic and sociohistorical reality.
> -   Traditional philosophical logic views desire as acquisition stemming from lack (Plato), and even Kant's view of desire as producing representations remains idealistic and detached from material desiring-production.
> -   Fantasy is collective (group fantasy), not individual, and reflects the unity of desiring-production and social production, capable of investing energy repressively or revolutionarily.
> -   Desiring-machines and technical/social machines are the same in nature but differ in r√©gime: technical machines wear out while functioning properly, transmitting value; desiring-machines function through breakdown and produce value as a graft within the process.
> -   Art functions as a desiring-machine to disrupt social production by leveraging the breakdown mode, creating explosions that interfere with technical machines.
> -   Desiring-machines produce antiproduction intrinsically (primal psychic repression), while technical machines' antiproduction depends on external social conditions (social repression). The tension between these resembles secondary repression.
> -   There is only one production (of the real), expressed as desiring-production and social production, differing in r√©gime. The Body without Organs is a residuum of a deterritorialized socius, not its origin.
> -   Unlike previous social machines, capitalism decodes and deterritorializes flows (money-capital, free labor), substituting money for code and pushing towards a schizophrenic limit.
> -   Capitalism counteracts its deterritorializing tendency by installing artificial, imaginary, or symbolic territorialities (family, state, nation) to recode flows and maintain the limit of capital.
> -   Neurosis, perversion, and schizophrenia are best understood by their relationship to these modern artificial territorialities: the neurotic is trapped, the pervert plays with them, and the schizophrenic seeks radical deterritorialization.
> -   Schizophrenia is desiring-production at the limit of

### Clerambault and the Problem of Delirium as Secondary

<mark class="hltr-blue">The famous hypothesis put forward by the psychiatrist G. de Clerambault seemswell founded: delirium, which is by nature global and systematic, is a secondary phenomenon, a consequence of partial and local automatistic phenomena. (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=3&annotation=D8JDWRV2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">They reference French psychiatrist Gatian de Cl√©rambault who considers delirium to be a secondary phenomenon. As noted in Chapter 1.3, for Schreber to declare that he is becoming a woman, he must first internalizethe delirium. This process depends on on the delirious nature of what defines a woman. Whatever constitutes the concept of a woman ‚Äî whatever‚Äòwoman‚Äô even means ‚Äî must exist prior to the delirium in the form of affections upon Schreber‚Äôs body without organs</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=3&annotation=ZJXZZ8Z4) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">delirium is essentially imagination itself. In otherwords, delirium is a secondary phenomenon that does not strictly adhere toa linear path of recording; instead, delirium diverges from the path of recording. If this divergence becomes significant enough to create abifurcation, it is referred to as schizophrenia</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=4&annotation=ATB5K7NX) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Delirium is in fact characteristic of the recording that is made of the process of production of the desiring-machines; and though there are syntheses and disorders (af ections) that are peculiar to this recording process, as we see in paranoia andeven in the paranoid forms of schizophrenia, it does not constitute an autonomous sphere, for it depends on the functioning and the breakdowns of desiring-machines. (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=5&annotation=J4SP649N) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In Anti-Oedipus,schizophrenia is understood in two distinct ways. First, there isschizophrenia as a clinical condition, which is highlighted in the sixthparagraph of this section. In this case, schizophrenia is interrupted or put into the context of an end goal; these are the people found in mental institutions. Second, there is schizophrenia as a process of decoding and deterritorializing flows of desire, which is highlighted in the final few paragraphs of this section. In the first case ‚Äî the case of the clinical entity schizophrenia as a process of decoding and deterritorialization becomesinterrupted or turned into an end goal where schizophrenia is divorcedfrom its processual nature. In the second case, schizophrenia serves as a process in a state of becoming. Regardless, delirium is especially important in the context of all cases of schizophrenia because it represents a departure from an established path of recording. The difference betweenschizophrenia as a clinical condition and schizophrenia as a process ofdecoding and deterritorialization lies in the degree to which this delirium manifests.</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=5&annotation=8ALWCM8M) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">nothing is independent of the production process</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=5&annotation=NF5S4RQX) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For example, Deleuze and Guattarireference paranoid forms of schizophrenia, such as a paranoid schizophrenicbelieving that someone intends to harm them, even if no such threat exists.However, it‚Äôs important to emphasize that these beliefs, thoughts, oraffections do not exist in isolation; they are not part of an autonomoussphere. Paranoid schizophrenia and the deliriums associated with it aresecondary to the recording process itself. It is contingent upon thefunctioning and breakdown of desiring-machines, meaning that all thesephenomena are interconnected and dependent upon the process of production.</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=6&annotation=8HMEEJ4L) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Nonetheless Clerambault used the term ‚Äú(mental) automatism‚Äù to designate onlyathematic phenomena ‚Äî echolalia, the uttering of odd sounds, or sudden irrational outbursts ‚Äî which he attributed to the mechanical ef ects of infections or intoxications. (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=7&annotation=EVNM8MGH) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Moreover, [Clerambault] explained a large part of delirium in turn as an ef ect ofautomatism; as for the rest of it, the ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù part, in his view it was of thenature of a reaction and had to do with ‚Äúcharacter,‚Äù the manifestations of which might well precede the automatism (as in the paranoiac character, for instance).  (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=7&annotation=8MRYINNK) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Clerambault finds these behaviors to be isolated incidents rather than a secondary result of the functioning andbreakdown of desiring-machines.</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=7&annotation=M24UA5NP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Clerambault identifies two keyaspects of delirium. First, he views delirium as resulting from automatism,suggesting that certain responses or behaviors are automatic and caused byphysical conditions like infections or intoxications. Second, he posits that the remaining aspects of delirium are linked to an individual‚Äôs character, whymay influence of precede these automatic responses</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=7&annotation=SKNM36PK) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Clerambault regarded automatism as merely a neurological mechanism inthe most general sense of the word, rather than a process of economic productioninvolving desiring-machines. (AO, 22; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=8&annotation=7LHHETNK) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">As for history, [Clerambault] was content merely to mention its innate or acquirednature. (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=9&annotation=SKRCRMBI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Clerambault‚Äôs brief mention of history is insufficient for Dleuze and Guattari.Clerambault considers history to be either innate (inherent from birth),acquired (shaped by one‚Äôs character), or a combination of both. However,Deleuze and Guattari critique this view for being overly reductive.Clerambault emphasizes automatism and treats experiences as isolated rather than part and parcel with the sociohistorical field.</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=9&annotation=KRF5ZMN4) 

- [N] Deleuze and Guattari find Clerambault's hypothesis about delirium as secondary and arising from partial automatisms interesting, but critique his understanding of automatism and history as isolated neurological or individual traits, rather than connected to the sociohistorical and desiring-production field.

> This section introduces G. de Cl√©rambault's concept of delirium as a secondary phenomenon stemming from automatistic occurrences. Deleuze and Guattari agree that delirium is secondary to the process of production, but critique Cl√©rambault for attributing automatism solely to isolated neurological or character-based factors, failing to see their connection to sociohistorical processes and desiring-machines. They emphasize that delirium is tied to the functioning and breakdown of desiring-machines and that schizophrenia, understood both clinically and as a process of decoding/deterritorialization, involves a departure from established recording paths.

### The Task of a Materialist Psychiatry

<mark class="hltr-green">A truly materialist psychiatry can be defined, on the contrary, by the twofold taskit sets itself: introducing desire into the mechanism, and introducing production into desire. (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=10&annotation=2D539RGY) 

- [N] A materialist psychiatry must integrate desire into the mechanics of production and production into desire, treating them as interconnected forces.

> A materialist psychiatry is defined by the twofold task of introducing desire into the mechanisms of the unconscious and introducing production into the understanding of desire. This contrasts with approaches that isolate these elements.

### Critique of Traditional Schizophrenia Theories: Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Binswanger

<mark class="hltr-blue">There is no very great dif erence between false materialism and typical forms ofidealism. (AO, 22; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=11&annotation=T8BJUN54) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The theory of schizophrenia is formulated in terms of three concepts that constituteits trinary schema: dissociation (Kraepelin), autism (Bleuler), and space-time or being-in-the-world (Binswanger). (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=11&annotation=47JYWESN) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Dissociation (Kraepelin</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=11&annotation=YNSKX5NH) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">[Kraepelin‚Äôs concept] is an explanatory concept that supposedly locates the specific dysfunction or primary deficiency. (AO, 22)</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=13&annotation=MLZN53X7) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Kraepelin introduced the concept of dissociation to explain dementia praecox, proposing that the disorder was rooted in a specific dysfunction or deficiency, which he largely understood to be a biological impairment.</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=13&annotation=Z3UQZ9T3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Autism (Bleuler</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=13&annotation=4Y7P3WRB) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">[Bleuler‚Äôs concept] is an ideational concept indicating the specific nature of theef ect of the disorder: the delirium itself or the complete withdrawal from the outside world, ‚Äúthe detachment from reality, accompanied by a relative or an absolute predominance of [the schizophrenic‚Äôs] inner life.‚Äù (AO, 22‚Äì23)</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=15&annotation=ZX73B8CJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">and recognizing a Bleuler offered a broaderperspective, acknowledging degrees of impairment wider range of behaviors. He introduced the concept of ‚Äúautism‚Äù as a symptom ofschizophrenia, which, in his usage, referred to a literal, etymological senseof the word: autism as being closed off or detached from reality.</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=15&annotation=MEUFQP7U) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Space-time or being-in-the-world (Binswanger</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=15&annotation=PD4X2WXQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Swiss psychiatrist, Ludwig Binswanger, was concerned with how individualswith schizophrenia interacted with and perceived their environment.</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=16&annotation=FVSXKLFI) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">[Binswanger‚Äôs] concept is a descriptive one, discovering or rediscovering the delirious person in his own specific world. (AO, 23)</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=17&annotation=UMA347JR) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">What is common to these three concepts is the fact that they all relate the problem of schizophrenia to the ego through the intermediary of the ‚Äúbody image‚Äù ‚Äî the final avatar of the soul, a vague conjoining of the requirements of spiritualismand positivism. (AO, 23)</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=17&annotation=E2ZW5WBK) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Though Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Binswanger differ in how they conceptualize schizophrenia, they all have one thing in common: the ego.</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=17&annotation=4LWFCU27) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">These theorists fall short by conceptualizing schizophrenia solely as an individual pathology. Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs critique focuses on theassumption that a coherent self exists beneath schizophrenia and that this self can be discovered by overcoming the disorder. They argue thatschizophrenia should be understood in the context of sociohistorical conditions, rather than through an idealized concept of the body and its expected functions</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=17&annotation=3W5VGLJ3) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The ego, however, is like daddy-mommy: the schizo has long since ceased to believein it. [The schizo] is somewhere else, beyond or behind or below these problems, rather than immersed in them. (AO, 23</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=18&annotation=5REUFIH3) 

- [N] Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Binswanger offer different concepts for schizophrenia (dissociation, autism, being-in-the-world) but share a focus on the ego and the idea of an underlying coherent self.
- [N] Deleuze and Guattari critique this focus on the ego, arguing that schizophrenia should be understood in relation to sociohistorical conditions rather than as an individual pathology or deviation from an idealized body concept.

> This section critiques traditional psychiatric approaches to schizophrenia by Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Binswanger. While their concepts (dissociation, autism, space-time) offer different perspectives, they are unified by a focus on the ego and the assumption of an underlying self, which Deleuze and Guattari reject. They argue that schizophrenia transcends the ego and should be understood in the context of sociohistorical processes rather than idealized individual pathology.

### Schizophrenia Beyond the Oedipal Framework

<mark class="hltr-blue">And wherever [the schizo] is, there are problems, insurmountable suf erings,unbearable needs. But why try to bring [the schizo] back to what [the schizo] has escaped from, why set [the schizo] back down amid problems that are no longer problems to [the schizo], why mock his truth by believing that we have paid it its due by merely figuratively taking our hats of to it? (AO, 23)</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=19&annotation=7ISGCWWC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Why insist on making the schizo confront the issues of mommy and daddy when they have already escaped the issues ofmommy and daddy?</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=19&annotation=GP4CZIIX) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">There are those who will maintain that the schizo is incapable of uttering the wordI, and that we must restore his ability to pronounce this hallowed word. All of which the schizo sums up by saying: they‚Äôre fucking me over again. (AO, 23)</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=20&annotation=5DT9RV7L) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">‚ÄúI won‚Äôt say I any more, I‚Äôll never utter the word again; it‚Äôs just too damn stupid.Every time I hear it, I‚Äôll use the third person instead, if I happen to remember to. If it amuses them. And it won‚Äôt make one bit of dif erence.‚Äù (AO, 23)</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=20&annotation=CMBMXM4D) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">And if [the schizo] does chance to utter the word I again, that won‚Äôt make anydif erence either. [The schizo] is too far removed from these problems, too far pastthem. (AO, 23</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=20&annotation=NYKPAVNL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Regarding the schizo being marginalized (or rather, the schizo being ‚Äòfucked over‚Äô), Deleuze and Guattari refer to Irish novelist Samuel Beckett‚Äôs 1953 novel, The Unnamable</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=20&annotation=98ZBHC5S) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus, although the the schizo says ‚ÄúI‚Äù , this ‚ÄúI‚Äù is fundamentally divorced from the Cartesian ‚ÄúI‚Äù:</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=20&annotation=PVAGESZ9) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">And what prevented him from doing so was his own tripartite formula ‚Äî theOedipal, neurotic one: daddy-mommy-me. (AO, 23</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=21&annotation=EBGRWH4J) 

- [N] Deleuze and Guattari question the therapeutic goal of forcing schizophrenics back into ego-centric or Oedipal frameworks that they have already moved beyond.
- [N] The schizophrenic's use of "I" is detached from the conventional, Cartesian subject, indicating a state of being beyond the Oedipal triangulation.
- [N] Traditional psychoanalysis, particularly the Oedipus complex, limits understanding by trapping individuals within the "daddy-mommy-me" structure.

> This section argues against forcing the schizophrenic into conventional frameworks centered on the ego or the Oedipus complex. They suggest that the schizophrenic has moved beyond these concerns, and attempts to restore a conventional sense of "I" or engage them in Oedipal issues are misguided. They invoke Samuel Beckett's "The Unnamable" to illustrate the schizophrenic's detached use of language and criticize psychoanalysis for being trapped by the Oedipal structure it propagates.

### Freud's Dislike of Schizophrenics and the Limit of Psychoanalysis

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Anti-Oedipus seeks to deconstruct SigmundFreud‚Äôs Oedipus complex which reduces the ego to these limitedperspectives.</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=21&annotation=ILTLXDRA) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It‚Äôs not that Freud lacked the ability to go beyond this limited conception ofthe ego; rather, his own propagation of the Oedipus complex restricted himfrom from moving beyond this limited conception of the ego:</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=21&annotation=WMK4Q533) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">For we must not delude ourselves: Freud doesn‚Äôt like schizophrenics. He doesn‚Äôt like their resistance to being oedipalized, and tends to treat them more or less as animals. (AO, 23; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=22&annotation=9TU44PZP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Freud wasunable to envision desire outside of this structure.</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5VMC6) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Freud‚Äôs harsh treatment of schizophrenics stems from his belief in a  normative subject capable of achieving transference. Anyone who falls outside of this established norm is subject to punishment:</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=22&annotation=ZF2Z6YAJ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">They mistake words for things, he says. They are apathetic, narcissistic, cut off  from reality, incapable of achieving transference; they resemble philosophers ‚Äúan undesirable resemblance.‚Äù (AO, 23; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=23&annotation=Z94TDF4W) 
- [N] [[Freud\|Freud]]

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Freud identifies a commonality between schizophrenics and philosophers,  noting an ‚Äúundesirable resemblance‚Äù between them, likening them to  animals. This is because Freud views the schizophrenic as incapable of  transference. In psychoanalytic theory, transference refers to the process by  which an analysand redirects their unconscious childhood feelings and  desires onto a new object, typically the therapist or psychoanalyst.</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=24&annotation=MBSDUBTC)

- [N] Freud's adherence to the Oedipus complex prevented him from understanding schizophrenia and desire outside this framework.
- [N] Freud disliked schizophrenics because they resist oedipalization and are seen as incapable of transference, which he views as necessary for analysis within his framework.

> This section highlights Freud's limitations in approaching schizophrenia due to his commitment to the Oedipus complex. Deleuze and Guattari argue that Freud's framework, which relies on concepts like transference and the Oedipal triangle, leads him to pathologize schizophrenics for not fitting into this model. They see this as evidence of how psychoanalysis is constrained by its own theoretical structures, preventing it from grasping desire beyond familial representation.

### Psychoanalysis: From Production to Representation

<mark class="hltr-blue">The fact is, from the  moment that we are placed within the framework of Oedipus ‚Äî from the moment  that we are measured in terms of Oedipus ‚Äî the cards are stacked against us, and  the only real relationship, that of production, has been done away with. (AO, 24)</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=25&annotation=P2KLVTK4) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A well-known saying attributed to psychologist Abraham Maslow is relevant  to this discussion: ‚ÄúIf the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to  treat everything as if it were a nail.‚Äù  When forced within the confines of Oedipus, we have already lost.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=25&annotation=TARYAHD2) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The great discovery of psychoanalysis was that of the production of desire, of the  productions of the unconscious. (AO, 24)</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=26&annotation=4ADTFD9T) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Yet, with the terrifying presence of Oedipus, this discovery becomes lost  within a series of symbols, all pertaining to parental figures:</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=26&annotation=FHMDJ9QN) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">But once Oedipus entered the picture, this discovery was soon buried beneath a  new brand of idealism: a classical theater was substituted for the unconscious as a  factory; representation was substituted for the units of production of the  unconscious; and an unconscious that was capable of nothing but expressing itself  ‚Äî in myth, tragedy, dreams ‚Äî was substituted for the productive unconscious.  (AO, 24)</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=26&annotation=NZAY87FR) 

<mark class="hltr-green">One of my favorite lines in the book is: ‚Äúa classical theater was substituted  for the unconscious as a factory.‚Äù In this passage, Deleuze and Guattari  argue that Oedipus functions merely as a system of representations,  reducing the unconscious to a theater with Oedipus is on stage.

- [N] Psychoanalysis's great discovery was the production of desire, but it was buried by the Oedipal framework.
- [N] The Oedipus complex replaces the unconscious as a factory with a classical theater, substituting representation for production and an expressive unconscious for a productive one.

> This section argues that psychoanalysis, despite initially discovering the productive nature of the unconscious, became derailed by the Oedipus complex. By framing everything through Oedipal relations, psychoanalysis substituted a system of representation (a theatrical model) for the actual production of desire (a factory model), thereby losing sight of the unconscious's inherent productivity.

### The Limits of Understanding Schizophrenia Through the Ego

<mark class="hltr-blue">Every time that the problem of schizophrenia is explained in terms of the ego, all we can do is ‚Äúsample‚Äù a supposed essence or a presumed specific nature of the schizo, regardless of whether we do so with love and pity or disgustedly spit out themouthful we have tasted. (AO, 24)</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=29&annotation=AJSG8I2J) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Whether we areempathetic or disdainful towards the schizophrenic, the approach ofunderstanding schizophrenia through the ego is inherently problematic.</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=29&annotation=4Z33PKQP) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Let us remember once again one of Marx‚Äôs caveats: we cannot tell from the mere taste of wheat who grew it; the product gives us no hint as to the system and therelations of production. (AO, 24)</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=30&annotation=MUF5YB6G) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Just as tasting wheat doesn‚Äôt reveal who grew it or the broader  agricultural system behind it, focusing solely on the ego fails to uncover the  deeper processes and social relations that contribute to the development of  schizophrenia and its associated symptoms.</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=31&annotation=2L5HP3MF) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The schizophrenic appears all the more specific and recognizable as a distinct  personality if the process is halted, or if it is made an end and a goal in itself, or if  it is allowed to go on and on endlessly in a void, so as to provoke that ‚Äúhorror of . .  . extremity wherein the soul and body ultimately perish‚Äù (the autist).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">common understandings of  schizophrenia are rooted in clinical methods, which often involve the  attempt to halt the process of production or turn the process of production  into an end goal ‚Äî such as policing the schizophrenic and forcing  conformity. The schizophrenic one finds in mental institutions is a clinical  entity; Deleuze and Guattari make a clear distinction between the  schizophrenic as a clinical entity and the schizophrenic as a subject  traversing the body without organs, aligning with nature as a process of  production.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=32&annotation=AFSX5R32) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">But the moment that one describes, on the contrary, the material process of  production, the specificity of the product tends to evaporate, while at the same  time the possibility of another outcome, another end result of the process appears.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari argue that defining  schizophrenia through the material process of production ‚Äîi.e., by  examining the processes by which the condition developed, much like  analyzing how wheat grew and who cultivated it ‚Äî leads to a similar  oversimplification.

- [N] Analyzing schizophrenia solely through the ego (as a "product") is like judging wheat by taste without considering its production, failing to understand the underlying processes and social relations.
- [N] Clinical understandings of schizophrenia focus on halting the process, defining the schizophrenic as a specific, often "terminal" entity.
- [N] Schizophrenia is fundamentally the *process* of production of desire and desiring-machines, not just a mental state or ego-related issue.
- [N] Jaspers viewed schizophrenia as a rupture in psychological development, but failed to connect this process to material economic and sociohistorical reality (Nature = Industry, Nature = History).

> This section argues that understanding schizophrenia solely through the lens of the ego is insufficient, drawing a parallel to Marx's point that a product doesn't reveal its production process. They distinguish the clinical entity of schizophrenia, which focuses on halting the process, from schizophrenia as the fundamental process of desiring-production itself. While acknowledging Jaspers' view of schizophrenia as a "rupture," they criticize him for not connecting this process to material economic reality and sociohistorical conditions.

### Desire as Production vs. Acquisition: Critique of Platonic and Kantian Idealism

<mark class="hltr-blue">To a certain degree, the traditional logic of desire is all wrong from the very outset:  from the very first step that the Platonic logic of desire forces us to take, making us  choose between production and acquisition. (AO, 25; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=38&annotation=M92H44Q2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For the Ancient Greek  philosopher, Plato, desire is viewed as yearning for what one is lacking (i.e.,  I desire something because I do not have it). A central aspect of Plato‚Äôs  philosophy is his Theory of Forms. According to this theory, there exists a  realm beyond the material world that is constituted by perfect, unchanging  Forms or Ideas. These Forms represent the true essence of all things. In  Plato‚Äôs view, the material world is merely a shadow of these ideal Forms</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=38&annotation=PGQ6KKKS) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">From the moment that we place desire on the side of acquisition, we make desire  an idealistic (dialectical, nihilistic) conception, which causes us to look upon it as  primarily a lack: a lack of an object, a lack of the real object. (AO, 25)</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=39&annotation=7ACD77ZB) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When desire is framed in terms of acquisition, it is made into an idealistic,  dialectical, and nihilistic concept. This perspective turns desire into an end  goal, forever in search of attaining the perfect, lost object. In this manner,  desire is understood in relation to lack ‚Äî a deficiency or void that one seeks  to fill by acquiring the lost object of desire.  For the religious individual, one lacks God or holiness. For the capitalist, one lacks capital.  For the psychoanalyst, one lacks the phallus.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=39&annotation=4H5JYSKT) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">It is true that the other side, the ‚Äúproduction‚Äù side, has not been entirely ignored.  (AO, 25)</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=40&annotation=6VQUBD55) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Kant, for instance, must be credited with effecting a critical revolution as regards  the theory of desire, by attributing to it ‚Äúthe faculty of being, through its  representations, the cause of the reality of the objects of these representations.‚Äù  (AO, 25; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=40&annotation=CQ2JJQR4) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The faculty of desire is a being‚Äôs faculty to be by means of its representations the cause of the reality of the objects of these representations.

- [N] [[Kant\|Kant]]

<mark class="hltr-blue">Kant‚Äôs view of desire departs from the traditional, Platonist notion of desirewhich conceptualizes desire in relation to acquiescence (also known aslack). For Platonism, something like hunger is understood in relation to lack: the subject lacks a sandwich (and attaining a sandwich would attempt to fulfill this lack). However, for Kant, desire is a productive force as ‚Äúthefaculty of being‚Äù ‚Äî that is, human faculties (i.e., the subject‚Äôs mind) ‚Äîrepresent objects and thus contribute to their existence. To use the previousexample, Kant believes that when one is hungry, desire produces an image of a sandwich in the subject‚Äôs mind which causes the subject to go out and make a sandwich (or buy one)</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=42&annotation=J8FZHD9J) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Kant argues that desire is tied to the capacity for representation, meaningthat objects of desire can exist conceptually in the mind even if they are notphysically present. This approach emphasizes that desire involves an active process of representation(s), where the mind plays a crucial role in the existence and experience of desired objects.</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=43&annotation=NXG3IS9B) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Kant maintains that desireshould be conceptualized as the capacity to represent and potentially realizeobjects, regardless of whether every instance of desire results in actual outcomes</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=43&annotation=H7I849MK) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">But it is not by chance that Kant chooses superstitious beliefs, hallucinations, and fantasies as illustrations of this definition of desire: as Kant would have it, we arewell aware that the real object can be produced only by an external causality and external mechanisms; nonetheless this knowledge does not prevent us from believing in the intrinsic power of desire to create its own object ‚Äî if only in anunreal, hallucinatory, or delirious form ‚Äî or from representing this causality as stemming from within desire itself. (AO, 25)</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=44&annotation=YTGXQ2N5) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">‚Ä¶ The basic phenomenon of hallucination (I see, I hear) and the basicphenomenon of delirium (I think . . . ) presuppose an I feel at an even deeper level, which gives hallucinations their object and thought delirium its content. (AO, 18; emphasis mine</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=45&annotation=ZFI47F5L) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Rather than conceptualizing desire as a process of production along with the sensations that produce subjectivity, Kant is limited in his view of desire as solely mental representations.</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=45&annotation=I8QX7JJR) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In Kant‚Äôs framework, desire in relation to lack or acquisition persists. Kant‚Äôsfocus on representations and ‚Äúpsychic realities‚Äù highlights the erroneousnotion that mental constructs and ‚Äúpsychic realities‚Äù are separate from anactualized, material reality. Kant‚Äôs understanding of desire asserts thatwhen a subject desires, wishes, or hallucinates an object, this very subject islacking something and fundamentally divorced from these objects. (Kantfails to take into account desiring-production, partial objects as he isstarting from the position of a global person.) Thus, while desire mayproduce mental images or representations of objects, these representations are a means to address what the subject is lacking or missing in the materialworld.</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=47&annotation=9ZDMLC8K) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is no  psychic reality, desire, wish, or series of hallucinations that exist  independently from the subject being produced by feelings and sensations.  The ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù precedes everything.</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=47&annotation=RWMD3JPS) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In point of fact, if desire is the lack of the real object, its very nature as a real entity depends upon an ‚Äúessence of lack‚Äù that produces the fantasized object. (AO, 25)</mark> [Page 48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=48&annotation=WCZYH5FM) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Desire thus conceived of as production, though merely the production of fantasies, has been explained perfectly by psychoanalysis. (AO, 25)</mark> [Page 48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=48&annotation=KMQIIRUD)

- [N] Platonic logic views desire as acquisition, stemming from a lack of a real object, leading to an idealistic and nihilistic conception.
- [N] Kant introduced the idea of desire as a productive faculty (producing representations), but his focus on mental representations and "psychic realities" still operates within a framework of lack and is disconnected from the material reality of desiring-production and the primacy of "I feel" sensations.
- [N] Psychoanalysis has perfectly explained desire conceived as *production* of fantasy, but this still relies on the premise that desire is rooted in lack, which creates a fantasized object.

> This section critiques the traditional philosophical understanding of desire, starting with the Platonic concept of desire as acquisition stemming from lack. While acknowledging Kant's step toward viewing desire as productive (through representation), Deleuze and Guattari argue that Kant's framework remains idealistic, focusing on mental representation rather than material production. They contend that even psychoanalysis's understanding of desire as producing fantasy is based on the erroneous premise of desire originating from lack.

### Fantasy as Group Fantasy, Not Individual

<mark class="hltr-blue">Thus fantasy is never individual: it is group fantasy ‚Äî as institutional analysis  has successfully demonstrated. (AO, 30; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=90&annotation=QTTA4D37) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Guattari engaged with Lacanian concepts and reinterpreted them. Within the  framework of ‚Äúinstitutional psychotherapy,‚Äù Guattari preferred the term  ‚Äúinstitutional analysis,‚Äù framing his work as a political endeavor. As a result,  fantasies conceptualized by psychoanalyis were always individual; in reality,  fantasies are always collective, shaped by groups.</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=90&annotation=4GK4ET4X) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">One way to conceptualize group fantasies is through collective identities,  such as ‚Äòbeing a man or woman‚Äô or ‚Äòbeing an American.‚Äô These identities are  not inherent to the individual; they are constructed and maintained by  groups, shaped through collective identity formations and social norms.</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=91&annotation=IK7KKKC9) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">And if there is such a thing as two sorts of group fantasy, it is because two different  readings of this identity are possible, depending upon whether the desiringmachines are regarded from the point of view of the great gregarious masses that  they form, or whether social machines are considered from the point of view of the  elementary forces of desire that serve as a basis for them. (AO, 30)</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=91&annotation=573RNUUX) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">On one hand, group fantasies are shaped by the  production of ‚Äògreat gregarious masses‚Äô through desiring-machines, and on the other hand, they are influenced by social machines, which are grounded  in the ‚Äòelementary forces of desire.‚Äô Ultimately, both perspectives point to the  same conclusion: desiring-production and social production are  inseparable, functioning as two aspects of the same process.</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=91&annotation=FEHZVSPP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Within group fantasy, energy may be invested in a repressive manner or a  revolutionary one</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=92&annotation=SUATVC5B) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Hence in group fantasy the libido may invest all of an existing social field,  including the latter‚Äôs most repressive forms; or on the contrary, it may launch a  counterinvestment whereby revolutionary desire is plugged into the existing social  field as a source of energy. (AO, 30)</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=92&annotation=H39LBFLY) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">(The great socialist Utopias of the nineteenth century function, for example, not  as ideal models but as group fantasies ‚Äî that is, as agents of the real productivity  of desire, making it possible to disinvest the current social field, to  ‚Äúdeinstitutionalize‚Äù it, to further the revolutionary institution of desire itself.)  (AO, 30‚Äì31; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=92&annotation=NZBVUE3F) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">these utopias ‚Äî according to Deleuze and Guattari ‚Äî function as ‚Äògroup  fantasies‚Äô in the sense that they reflect the collective aspirations of specific  social groups rather than serving as rigid blueprints for future society.</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=92&annotation=PTINBZ2P) 

- [N] Institutional analysis shows that fantasy is collective (group fantasy), not individual, shaped by groups and collective identities.
- [N] Group fantasies can be understood from the perspective of desiring-machines forming masses or social machines based on desire's elementary forces, both pointing to the inseparability of desiring-production and social production.
- [N] Libidinal energy in group fantasy can either reinforce repressive social forms or fuel revolutionary counterinvestment.
- [N] Socialist utopias function as group fantasies, acting as agents of desire's productivity to disinvest and "deinstitutionalize" the current social field, promoting a revolutionary institution of desire.

> This section introduces the concept of "group fantasy," arguing against the psychoanalytic notion of individual fantasy. Drawing on institutional analysis, they posit that fantasies are collective phenomena shaped by groups and social norms. Group fantasies are manifestations of the interplay between desiring-machines forming masses and social machines based on desire, highlighting the unity of desiring-production and social production. This collective energy can be directed repressively or towards revolutionary change, with socialist utopias cited as examples of revolutionary group fantasies.

### Desiring-Machines and Technical Machines: Differences in R√©gime

<mark class="hltr-blue">But there is never any difference in nature between the desiring-machines and the  technical social machines. There is a certain distinction between them, but it is  merely a distinction of r√©gime,* depending on their relationships of size. Except for  this difference in r√©gime, they are the same machines, as group fantasies clearly  prove. (AO, 31)</mark> [Page 93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=93&annotation=XAHW2MYM) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">When in the course of our discussion above, we laid down the broad outlines of a  parallelism between social production and desiring-production, in order to show  that in both cases there is a strong tendency on the part of the forces of  antiproduction to operate retroactively on (se rabattre sur) productive forms and appropriate them, this parallelism was in no way meant as an exhaustive  description of the relationship between the two systems of production. (AO, 31)</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=94&annotation=7BAYRGJ7) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">[The parallelism] merely enables us to point to certain phenomena having to do  with the difference in r√©gime between them. (AO, 31)</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=95&annotation=7JN9IFRF) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In the first place, technical machines obviously work only if they are not out of  order; they ordinarily stop working not because they break down but because  they wear out. (AO, 31; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=95&annotation=JACC7DE2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Simondon gives a simple  explanation of the technical object that we call the ‚Äòtool‚Äô:</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=95&annotation=H2BESS6X) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Take a tool. What is essential in a tool? It is an intermediary between the body of  the operator and the things on which [the operator] acts... In order to be a good  tool: be unbreakable, be well-constituted.</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=95&annotation=F78KLPLA) 
- [N] [[Simondon\|Simondon]]

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Technical machines operate by maintaining an order of arrangements  within an ensemble, and akin to desiring-machines, they function through a  continuous process of breaking down. In other words, they work through a  process of becoming and adaptation. These breakdowns reveal the limits  (and potentiality) of their current configurations, opening up possibilities  for reconfiguration. However, they do stop working under the condition of  their deterioriation or their ‚Äòwearing out.‚Äô</mark> [Page 96](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=96&annotation=XFW8R9GG) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Marx makes use of this simple principle to show that the r√©gime of technical  machines is characterized by a strict distinction between the means of production  and the product; thanks to this distinction, the machine transmits value to the  product, but only the value that the machine itself loses as it wears out. (AO, 31)</mark> [Page 96](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=96&annotation=88N3G5W9) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Marx makes a strategic move where he isolates that a technical machine  does not add intrinsic value to the product it produces ‚Äî at least in the sense  of ‚Äúcreating‚Äù value; rather, a technical machine simply transfers value to the  product as the technical machine wears down. The product‚Äôs value is  dependent on the depreciation of the machine that produces it.</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=97&annotation=PWDZMJNV) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Desiring-machines, on the contrary, continually break down as they run, and in  fact run only when they are not functioning properly: the product is always an  offshoot of production, implanting itself upon it like a graft, and at the same time  the parts of the machine are the fuel that makes it run. (AO, 31)</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=97&annotation=PK54J2WY) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Unlike technical machines, desiring-machines only function through  wearing out or ‚Äúnot functioning properly.‚Äù While technical machines  operate by breaking down, they only continue to work as long as they are not  wearing out; they transfer value to the product through their deterioration,  until they eventually dissolve. In contrast, desiring-machines work through  their breakdowns, or more precisely, through their wearing out, where the  product emerges within the ongoing process of production, alongside  desiring-machines.</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=97&annotation=5LN2W85H) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Consider this example to sum up our progression: If someone works at a  shoe factory and operates a technical shoe machine, the shoe machine will  gradually wear down over time as it produces shoes, and transfers its value  to the shoes, leading to its eventual dissolution. However, the machine  remains functional as long as it is in working order and undergoing breakdowns. It is only once the machine has fully worn out that it ceases to  function.</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=97&annotation=SR33R98F) 

- [N] Desiring-machines and technical/social machines are the same in nature but differ in "r√©gime" or mode of operation.
- [N] Technical machines work by functioning correctly until they wear out, transmitting value to the product as they depreciate (Marx). There is a distinction between means of production and product.
- [N] Desiring-machines function *through* breakdown ("not functioning properly"), with the product emerging as a graft within the process itself and machine parts serving as fuel. The distinction between production and product is blurred.

> This section clarifies the relationship between desiring-machines and technical/social machines, stating they are the same in nature but differ in their "r√©gime." Technical machines operate correctly and transmit value as they wear out, maintaining a distinction between production means and product. Desiring-machines, conversely, function through breakdown and wearing out, with the product emerging directly from the ongoing process of production, blurring the lines between means and product. This difference in operational mode (r√©gime) distinguishes them despite their shared fundamental nature.

### Art as a Desiring-Machine Disrupting Social Production

<mark class="hltr-purple">Paragraph Sixteen</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=98&annotation=RDTT4ZQE) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Art often takes advantage of this property of desiring-machines by creating  veritable group fantasies in which desiring-production is used to short-circuit  social production, and to interfere with the reproductive function of technical  machines by introducing an element of dysfunction. (AO, 31)</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=98&annotation=7XUHEMGP) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Art creates collective fantasies that resonate beyond individuals, influencing  society as a whole. Art, consumed in a raw and unregulated way, bypasses the norms of social production. Unlike technical machines, which transfer value  to their products through their ‚Äòwearing out‚Äô, art is produced alongside  desiring-machines, disrupting technical machines and social machines,  serving as ‚Äúan element of dysfunction.‚Äù Now, none of this assumes that art  cannot be commodified by capitalism; Deleuze and Guattari are solely  analyzing how art can short-circuit social production.</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=98&annotation=NPF849QY)

<mark class="hltr-blue">But even earlier, Ravel preferred to throw his inventions entirely out of gear rather  than let them simply run down, and chose to end his compositions with abrupt  breaks, hesitations, tremolos, discordant notes, and unresolved chords, rather than  allowing them to slowly wind down to a close or gradually die away into silence.

<mark class="hltr-blue">The artist is the master of objects; he puts before us shattered, burned, brokendown objects, converting them to the r√©gime of desiring-machines, breaking down  is part of the very functioning of desiring-machines; the artist presents paranoiac  machines, miraculating-machines, and celibate machines as so many technical  machines, so as to cause desiring-machines to undermine technical machines.  (AO, 32)</mark> [Page 103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=103&annotation=52Q685SR) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari emphasize the signifiance of the artist‚Äôs  unconventional nature, using ‚Äúbroken-down objects‚Äù as a key element. They  associate this breakdown with the functioning of desiring-machines; they  argue that the machines found in the second and third syntheses of  unconscious are portrayed as technical machines, suggesting that art breaks  down the technical machines of desiring-production while simultaneously  interfering with their reproduction at the level of social production.</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=104&annotation=57YC5P2Z) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Even more important, the work of art is itself a desiring-machine.

- [N] Examples like Arman's work, Cesar's sculptures, Dali's critical paranoia, and Ravel's musical style demonstrate how artists use dysfunction and explosion to undermine social production and conventional forms.
- [N] The work of art itself is a desiring-machine, creating immediate explosions rather than gradual processes, unlike technical machines that transmit value through wear.

> This section explores how art functions as a desiring-machine to disrupt social production. Artists utilize the characteristic "breakdown" mode of desiring-machines to create group fantasies that interfere with the reproductive function of technical/social machines. Examples from visual art (Arman, Cesar, Dali) and music (Ravel) illustrate this disruptive potential. The work of art itself is presented as a desiring-machine that short-circuits established processes through rapid, explosive creation.

### The Socius as Analogue to the Body Without Organs and the Role of Repression

<mark class="hltr-blue">From this, a second difference in r√©gime results: desiring-machines produce  antiproduction all by themselves, whereas the antiproduction characteristic of  technical machines takes place only within the extrinsic conditions of the  reproduction of the process (even though these conditions do not come into being  at some ‚Äúlater stage‚Äù). (AO, 32)</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=106&annotation=XX2RZBFL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the three syntheses of the unconscious, we see the antiproductive nature  of the body without organs fall back on the process of production,  appropriating the surplus energy of desiring-production for itself. This  results in desiring-machines producing antiproduction through their  interactions upon the body without organs. However, technical machines do  not produce antiproduction on their own. Instead, their antiproduction  arises within the ‚Äúextrinsic conditions of the reproduction of the process.‚Äù  In simpler terms, technical machines must refer back to a socius or social  machine.</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=106&annotation=GKNCGP4K) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">That is why technical machines are not an economic category, and always refer  back to a socius or a social machine that is quite distinct from these machines,  and that conditions this reproduction. (AO, 32; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=106&annotation=BGRRWVXI) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">A technical machine is therefore not a cause but merely an index of a general  form of social production: thus there are manual machines and primitive  societies, hydraulic machines and ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù forms of society, industrial machines  and capitalism. (AO, 32)</mark> [Page 107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=107&annotation=JAU2EAUQ) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Manual machines refer to the devices developed in early societies, from  the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras and some continuing eras thereafter.  These machines are simple and what Simondon described as abstract  technical objects. These devices rely on human labor for operation, rather  than external energy sources such as water or steam.</mark> [Page 107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=107&annotation=AMIAPH9G) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Hydraulic machines refer to devices developed by ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù societies that  use liquid (specifically water) to perform processes. These machines  were common in early industrial processes serving an important role in  irrigation and milling. For example, ancient Greece and Rome  particularly had sophisticated hydraulic machines like those of  watermills and pioneers in hydraulic engineering. Other significant  hydraulic machines were chain pumps, like those developed in ancient  China. Even though chain pumps require some amount of labor, it makes  the process much more efficient as the pump moves water upwards  without requiring constant manual labor.</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=109&annotation=I7NH6P9I) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Industrial machines refer to devices developed by capitalist societies in  order to increase capitalist production; these devices can look like  factories, tools, and engines that contribute to the production,  distribution, and consumption of commodities. These machines produce  goods in a structured fashion. A specific example that comes to mind is  Henry Ford‚Äôs moving assembly line as seen in Figure Sixty-Three.</mark> [Page 111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=111&annotation=9VJQH3QB) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs primary  concern is not with rigid classifications of machines, but rather with which  types of machines dominate the socius at a given time, shaping production  and social organization.</mark> [Page 113](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=113&annotation=6H52YZ6M) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">As we have outlined the second distinction in r√©gime between desiringmachines and technical machines (with the technical machines being  indexical to their corresponding socius), Deleuze and Guattari emphasize  that while desiring-production and social production are the same with two  differences in r√©gime, there remains a crucial distinction</mark> [Page 114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=114&annotation=KS9KF6SD) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Hence when we posited the socius as the analogue of a full body without organs,  there was nonetheless one important difference. (AO, 32)</mark> [Page 114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=114&annotation=AHD8QSQJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To grasp this crucial difference between desiring-machines and the socius,  Deleuze and Guattari first explain that desiring-machines make no  distinctions between anything:</mark> [Page 114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=114&annotation=XRTF3M33) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">For desiring-machines are the fundamental category of the economy of desire; they  produce a body without organs all by themselves, and make no distinction between  agents and their own parts, or between the relations of production and their own  relations, or between the social order and technology. (AO, 32)</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=115&annotation=Y9H4DPA4) 

<mark class="hltr-green">From the standpoint of desiring-machines, everything is interconnected  through various emissions and interruptions of flows that pass through  them; unlike social production, desiring-production finds that there is no  distinction between the socius and technical machines that are produced  externally by them. Similarly, there is no distinction between an agent and  the parts that make up that agent.</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=115&annotation=WB4JEZQI) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Desiring-machines are both technical and social. (AO, 32)</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=115&annotation=WGFZSD23) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the fundamental distinction between desiring-production and  social production lies in where repression takes place:</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=115&annotation=S4XJVJH4) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">It is in this sense that desiring-production is the locus of a primal psychic  repression*, whereas social production is where social repression takes place, and  it is between the former and the latter that there occurs something that resembles  secondary psychic repression in the ‚Äústrictest‚Äù sense: the situation of the body  without organs or its equivalent is the crucial factor here, depending on whether it  is the result of an internal process or of an extrinsic condition (and thus affects the  role of the death instinct in particular). (AO, 32; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=115&annotation=UUWDKL9R) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">1974 English Translation: This ‚Äòprimal repression‚Äô determines repression in the  strict sense of the term, which is only made possible by the concerted action, upon  the elements destined to be repressed, of a force of repulsion exerted by a higher  agency and an attraction exerted by what has already been fixated.</mark> [Page 116](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=116&annotation=3SQ45LJ7) 
- [N] Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis

<mark class="hltr-blue">Freud saw primary repression as a foundational mechanism that  blocks unconscious desires from reaching conscious awareness. Once this  primary repression is in place, it sets the stage for the mind to repress new,  conscious thoughts or feelings as they arise. For example, if a child  experiences sexual curiosity by touching their genitals and is told that such  feelings and actions are ‚Äòshameful‚Äô or ‚Äòbad,‚Äô that impulse is repressed and  kept out of conscious awareness (primary repression), meaning the child is  unable to fully acknowledge the desire due to the external prohibition. Later  in life, when this person, now an adult, experiences sexual arousal, they may  also feel guilt as a result of this early repression (secondary repression).  Thus, for Freud, the guilt associated with sexual arousal is the outcome of a  secondary repression arising from a foundational primary repression.</mark> [Page 117](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=117&annotation=MPEKGRZI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In contrast to Freud, who suggests that secondary repression arises when  repressed thoughts resurface on top of a pre-established primary repression,  Deleuze and Guattari argue that repression is always primal and in the  context of the paranoiac-machine. When psychoanalysis speaks of primary  repression, they are really only speaking of paranoiac-machines. The term  ‚Äúprimary repression‚Äù suggests a type of succession that Deleuze and Guattari  are cautious of, while the word ‚Äúprimal‚Äù is much better as it enables us to  conceptualize repression at the level of machines without succession.  Deleuze and Guattari argue that it is not the ‚Äòreturn of repressed‚Äô impulses  that leads to a secondary repression, but rather the tension between  desiring-production (psychic repression) and social production (social  repression) which creates something that resembles secondary repression.</mark> [Page 118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=118&annotation=UAARX2NL) 

<mark class="hltr-green">According to the three syntheses, if the subject is continually recreated, then  how could secondary repression even exist? Everything is fundamentally  produced primarily as in primal; nothing can be secondary. In the second  synthesis, paranoiac-machine functions as ‚Äúprimal repression,‚Äù repelling  desiring-machines. This repulsion suspends connections between  machines. Simultaneously, a miraculating-machine functions to attract  desiring-machines back to the surface of the body without organs. For  example, a mouth-machine disconnects from a breast-machine, connect to  another machine, and then disconnect from that machine, initiating a series  of re-couplings. Then, in the third synthesis, the ‚Äúcelibate machine‚Äù  functions as a form of ‚Äúreturn of the repressed,‚Äù reconciling the tension  between paranoiac and miraculating machines and banding these  intensities produced by the paranoiac and miraculating-machines into a  consumable quantity for the subject (see Chapter 1.3, Paragraph One).</mark> [Page 118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=118&annotation=LYF2L5IP) 

<mark class="hltr-green">To put simply, a subject is reborn with each state that they consume: a  mouth-machine disconnects from a breast-machine and turns into a  vomiting-machine; a hand-machine is swatted away from a genitalmachine; an eye-machine connects to a pornography-machine; an adult  encounters an infidelity-machine; a person is subjected to the moral  judgements of a religious-machine. All of these experiences produce the the  subject without reawakening buried impulses ‚Äî repression is immanently  produced upon the body without organs. Deleuze and Guattari emphasize  that whatever resembles a secondary repression results from the continuous  interaction between psychic repression and social repression (but this  doesn‚Äôt constitute repression as secondary). Repression is not merely rooted  in childhood prohibitions, such as hearing that sex is ‚Äúshameful‚Äù; it‚Äôs about  the ongoing interaction between psychic and social repression, all  unfolding on the body without organs.</mark> [Page 119](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=119&annotation=678JL9JY) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">And finally, the death instinct mentioned here refers to the drive toward  destruction, which emerges from the interplay between desiring-production  and social production. Earlier, we explored how death is something that  desire desires ‚Äî but not in a negative sense. However, the role of death  changes depending on the specific relationship between the body without  organs and what resembles secondary psychic repression. Whether the  repression stems from an internal process or an external one shifts the nature  of this death drive from a positive, productive force into a destructive one.</mark> [Page 119](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=119&annotation=6CCWC5BI) 

- [N] Desiring-machines inherently produce antiproduction (via the Body without Organs), while technical machines' antiproduction requires external social conditions (the socius).
- [N] Technical machines are indices of social production forms (manual/primitive, hydraulic/Asiatic, industrial/capitalist), not causes of them.
- [N] Desiring-machines make no distinction between agents, parts, relations of production, or social order/technology; they are fundamentally both technical and social.
- [N] Desiring-production is the site of primal psychic repression, while social production is the site of social repression. The tension between these resembles secondary psychic repression.
- [N] Unlike Freud's concept of secondary repression building upon a fixed primary repression, Deleuze and Guattari see repression as always primal and immanent to the process. What resembles secondary repression arises from the dynamic interaction of psychic and social repression on the Body without Organs.
- [N] The death instinct's role shifts from productive to destructive based on whether repression is internal (desiring-production) or external (social production).

> This section delves into the second difference in r√©gime: desiring-machines produce antiproduction intrinsically, linked to primal psychic repression, whereas technical machines require external social conditions (the socius) for antiproduction (social repression). Technical machines are thus seen as indicators of social production forms, not their cause. The socius is presented as an analogue to the Body without Organs, but distinct. Desiring-machines are fundamentally technical *and* social, making no internal distinctions. The tension between desiring-production (psychic repression) and social production (social repression) produces something resembling secondary repression, which is understood not as a return of the repressed but as an ongoing process on the Body without Organs.

### Capitalism: Decoding, Reterritorialization, and the Schizophrenic Limit

<mark class="hltr-blue">The prime function incumbent upon the socius, has always been to codify the flows  of desire, to inscribe them, to record them, to see to it that no flow exists that is not properly dammed up, channeled, regulated. (AO, 33)</mark> [Page 124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=124&annotation=2B5WUNP4) 



<mark class="hltr-yellow">The primary role the social production in relation to the socius has always  been to codify, inscribe, and regulate the flows of desire. This ensures that  no flow remains uncontrolled or unchanneled. According to Deleuze and  Guattari, the socius functions as a surface that governs all desire, leaving no  flow unregulated or without boundaries; desire becomes regulated and  mapped out into a charted territory.</mark> [Page 125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=125&annotation=NHYABW55) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">When the primitive territorial machine proved inadequate to the task, the despotic  machine set up a kind of overcoding system. But the capitalist machine, insofar as  it was built on the ruins of a despotic State more or less far removed in time, finds  itself in a totally new situation: it is faced with the task of decoding and  deterritorializing the flows.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Capitalism,  unlike the primitive and despotic socius, does something radical.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Capitalism does not confront this situation from the outside, since it experiences it  as the very fabric of its existence, as both its primary determinant and its  fundamental raw material, its form and its function, and deliberately perpetuates  it, in all its violence, with all the powers at its command.

<mark class="hltr-green">Firstly, instead of applying fixed codes found in earlier societies, capitalism  decodes flows of production by using money as a universal stand-in across  the production process. This decoding of production allows for diverse types  of labor, goods, and services to be unified under a single, universally applicable measure: money. Unlike barter and traditional trade, money  circulates across industries and borders as a purely quantitive measure of  worth, untethered from any specific cultural or local meaning.</mark> [Page 127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=127&annotation=9W44SP69) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Secondly, instead of fixing labor in place through social codes, capitalism  decodes labor in order to make it universally exchangeable. Decoding labor  implies eradicating fixed, local meaning tied to work and labor, allowing  workers to move freely from one space to the next in order to sell their  labor. This enables labor itself to become a commodity, something that can  be bought and sold like any other good, based on supply and demand rather  than traditional roles or relationships.</mark> [Page 128](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=128&annotation=3RIQKKXT)

Devereux‚Äôs 1970 text Essais  d‚Äôethnopsychiatrie g√©n√©rale argues that mental illnesses like hysteria and  schizophrenia are culturally contingent, shaped by the norms and structures  of their respective societies. Jaspers, in his 1922 text (though Deleuze and  Guattari reference the version published in 1926) Strindberg und Van Gogh,  describes how earlier societies fostered forms of madness as authentic  existential experiences (i.e., madness was deemed as an authentic experience with spiritual significance). However, Jaspers states that modern  humans are incapable of producing authentic forms of madness, believing  that this drive towards madness is inauthentic due to madness being  pathologized and medicalized. Deleuze and Guattari engage with these  thinkers but heavily expand upon their ideas; the material conditions of  society, for Deleuze and Guattari, are responsible for these shifts in  madness ‚Äî an analysis that Jaspers lacks</mark> [Page 132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=132&annotation=6LAJWFC8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When Deleuze and Guattari ask if schizophrenia is the product of capitalism,  they could be denoting both schizophrenia as a clinical entity or  schizophrenia as a process of decoding and deterritorializing flows.

In the second  case, this question may be referring to schizophrenia as a process rather  than a clinical condition (i.e., the process of decoding and deterritorializing  flows): Does capitalism produce schizophrenia as a process that decodes flows of  production and labor? In this second case, schizophrenia as a process is  intrinsically linked to capitalism. Regardless, Deleuze and Guattar; question  serves essential to conceptualizing various maladies like schizophrenia,  manic-depression, along with hysteria, and how they relate to the various  modes of social production that they are produced in.</mark> [Page 133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=133&annotation=KBM6WCTZ) 

- [N] The socius's primary function is to codify and regulate flows of desire.
- [N] Unlike primitive and despotic societies which coded/overcoded flows, capitalism decodes and deterritorializes flows of production (money-capital) and labor (free worker).
- [N] Capitalism substitutes money for code, creating an "axiomatic" of abstract quantities that drives the deterritorialization of the socius. Money quantifies everything and is untethered from specific social or cultural meanings.
- [N] Capitalism tends towards a "schizophrenic limit" by decoding flows, aiming to turn the socius into a Body without Organs, but it is bound by the limit of capital and cannot fully achieve this.
- [N] The question is raised whether specific "madnesses" (schizophrenia, paranoia/manic-depression, hysteria) are products of specific socii (capitalism, despotism, primitive), linking psychological states to sociohistorical modes of production.

> This section contrasts capitalism with previous social formations (primitive, despotic) based on how they handle flows of desire. While earlier socii codified and regulated desire, capitalism's core function is decoding and deterritorializing flows (money-capital, free labor). By substituting money for code, capitalism creates an axiomatic of abstract quantities that pushes towards a "schizophrenic limit," aiming to unleash flows on a deterritorialized Body without Organs. However, capitalism is constrained by the limit of capital, constantly tending towards but not fully reaching this limit. This leads to the question of whether schizophrenia (as clinical entity or process) is specifically a product of the capitalist machine, unlike other "madnesses" tied to different social formations.

### Capitalism's Counteracted Tendency: Decoding and Recoding

<mark class="hltr-purple">Paragraph Nineteen</mark> [Page 134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=134&annotation=6S7G4FXD) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The decoding of flows and the deterritorialization of the socius thus constitutes the  most characteristic and the most important tendency of capitalism.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Capitalism constantly approaches a limit, as it ‚Äútends toward a threshold of  decoding.‚Äù However, this limit is not fixed; it‚Äôs a schizophrenic limit,  meaning it‚Äôs perpetually pushed further because capitalism itself decodes  the boundaries it reaches. Yet, capitalism also depends on the existence of capital (hence, it depends upon on a limit), which prevents it from  transcending the limit of capital altogether.</mark> [Page 134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=134&annotation=NKYIR2LD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Capitalism, in all its power, drives toward the creation of the schizophrenic  subject. As capital functions as a body without organs (presenting itself as a  surface of inscription for social production), capitalism propels the  emergence of the schizophrenic subject traversing its surface.

<mark class="hltr-green">Capitalism, by decoding flows of desire, aims to dismantle the very socius  upon which it depends; in doing so, capital is produced as a body without  organs (specifically, through the decoding of production and labor). We  must not forget that the three syntheses are at work here: capital serves as a  surface of recording that becomes produced by social production recording  points on this surface. However, through this ongoing decoding process,  capitalism approaches a schizophrenic limit (schizophrenia = decoding of  flows). And as capitalism approaches this limit, it simultaneously pushes this  limit further back due to capitalism producing the schizophrenic-subject  traversing the surface of capital. This schizo subject is capable of generating  capital while simultaneously destroying the structures by which capital is  produced: ‚Äúmore capitalist than the capitalist and more proletarian than  the proletariat.‚Äù</mark> [Page 136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=136&annotation=86BDFZ2Z) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">When we say that schizophrenia is our characteristic malady, the malady of our  era, we do not merely mean to say that modern life drives people mad.

<mark class="hltr-green">Deleuze and Guattari make it clear that they are not merely reducing  schizophrenia as the classical clinical diagnosis. Instead, they describe  schizophrenia as a process of production. In their critique of capitalism,  they argue that the ‚Äúillness of our time‚Äù reflects a decoding of flows;  schizophrenia here is not about individual madness, but a systemic process  purported by and through capitalism. The sickness they refer are referring  to is a societal condition, where capitalism‚Äôs decoding of desire has led to  routine 9-to-5 jobs, environmental destruction, hoarding of resources, and  exploitation of others ‚Äî all of which have become normalized. This is  sickness. None of this assumes that the people we find in psychiatric  institutes are not schizophrenic; rather, Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs  conceptualization of schizophrenia goes beyond psychiatric institutions and  individual mental health crises.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Nor is it merely a question of a simple parallelism, even though from the point of  view of the failure of codes, such a parallelism is a much more precise formulation  of the relationship between, for example, the phenomena of shifting of meaning in  the case of schizophrenics and the mechanisms of ever increasing disharmony and  discord at every level of industrial society. (AO, 34; emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=137&annotation=HQ3MSEXT) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">if we were to draw a parallel between the two, they both share a  similar process of destabilization or breakdown of codes (‚Äúfailing of codes‚Äù).  In schizophrenia, meaning is constantly shifting (whether it be words, social  norms, etc.); it is as though ‚Äúcodes‚Äù of reality are falling apart for the  schizophrenic. In capitalism, society experiences a breakdown where  disharmony occurs at ‚Äúevery level of industrial society‚Äù; it is as though  ‚Äúcodes‚Äù of labor, economic organization, and social relations are falling  apart. Again, while schizophrenia and capitalism are not the same, they are  both extremely similar in their relationship to decoding.</mark> [Page 138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=138&annotation=KYJXEJ23) 

- [N] Capitalism's main tendency is decoding flows and deterritorializing the socius, constantly approaching a schizophrenic limit, but bound by the limit of capital.
- [N] Capitalism attempts to produce the "schizo subject" as the subject of decoded flows on the Body without Organs ‚Äì a figure embodying both capitalist drive and revolutionary potential.
- [N] Schizophrenia is considered the characteristic "malady" of our era, not as individual madness but as a process of production inherent to capitalism's decoding of flows, leading to societal disharmony and breakdown of codes.

> This section elaborates on capitalism's core process of decoding and deterritorializing flows, identifying it as the characteristic tendency that pushes towards a schizophrenic limit. Bound by the limit of capital, capitalism constantly approaches but cannot fully reach this limit. It attempts to produce the "schizo subject" as the ultimate expression of these decoded flows. Schizophrenia is framed here not just as a clinical condition but as a societal process inherent to capitalism's mode of production, reflecting a general breakdown and shifting of codes.

Through this  process of decoding and recoding, capitalism continuously produces  countless ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù and ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù territories, adapting them to sustain  itself.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Marx termed the twofold movement of the tendency to a falling rate of profit, and  the increase in the absolute quantity of surplus value, the law of the counteracted  tendency. (AO 34)</mark> [Page 143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=143&annotation=55B2VP49) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Marx‚Äôs law of the counteracted tendency, also known as the  tendency of the rate of profit to fall, describes how the rate of profit in  capitalist economies tends to decline over time. This happens because  capitalists invest more in machinery (constant capital) relative to labor  (variable capital). Earlier, we discussed Simondon‚Äôs concept of the technical  machine. When a capitalist purchases a machine, it has a set market-value  (constant capital) which is gradually transmitted to products that the  machine produces. The reason the rate of profit falls as capitalists invest  more in machinery is that profit comes from the exploitation of labor.  Unlike machines, which have a fixed value, labor generates surplus value  because workers are paid less than the value that they create. Essentially,  workers produce more value than they are compensated for, and this  difference is the profit for capitalists.</mark> [Page 143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=143&annotation=W9RKK8YM) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Let‚Äôs look at an example: A capitalist owns a factory that employs 100  workers. Does the capitalist like paying these 100 workers? Of course not! So,  the capitalist buys a machine that can replace 50 of those workers, firing  them in the process. However, even if the machine increases productivity by  producing goods faster ‚Äî it still has a fixed price. The machine can only  transmit its value to the products it produces, but it cannot generate surplus  value beyond its original cost. Now, the capitalist has one machine and 50 remaining workers, but here‚Äôs  the problem: the machine itself cannot create more profit. Therefore, the  capitalist has to counteract the fall of profit: to generate surplus value, the  capitalist must exploit labor. Perhaps the capitalist fires another 25 workers  and forces the remaining workers to work twice as hard. Or, the capitalist  might extend their hours, eliminate bathroom and lunch breaks, or cut  wages. Does the capitalist like paying these workers $10 an hour? Of course  not! So, the capitalist might fire the remaining 25 workers and rehire new  ones at $7.25 an hour, knowing that there are plenty of unemployed people  (100 of them fired from this job alone) eager to take those jobs.</mark> [Page 143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=143&annotation=SHEM33XV)

- [N] Capitalism generates "schizophrenic accumulation of energy" (decoded flows) which acts as its limit, against which it applies repression.
- [N] Capitalism simultaneously inhibits and allows free rein to this deterritorializing tendency, tending towards its limit while trying to avoid reaching it completely.
- [N] Capitalism institutes artificial, imaginary, or symbolic territorialities (States, families, nations) to recode and rechannel individuals defined by abstract quantities. This constitutes capitalism's ideology as a "motley painting."
- [N] The production of the real under capitalism becomes increasingly artificial, yet still remains the real.
- [N] Drawing on Marx's law of the counteracted tendency (falling rate of profit countered by increased surplus value), Deleuze and Guattari see a twofold movement in capitalism: deterritorialization/decoding to extract surplus value, and violent, artificial reterritorialization by state apparatuses absorbing surplus value.

> This section focuses on capitalism's inherent contradiction, mirroring Marx's law of the counteracted tendency. While capitalism's core tendency is to decode and deterritorialize flows, pushing towards a schizophrenic limit, it simultaneously counteracts this by installing artificial and symbolic territorialities (family, state, nation). This process of recoding attempts to contain the decoded flows and re-channel individuals defined by abstract quantities back into regulated structures, maintaining the limit of capital. This results in an increasingly artificial reality, but one that is still fundamentally real.

### Neurosis, Perversion, and Schizophrenia in Relation to Capitalist Territorialities

<mark class="hltr-purple">Paragraph Twenty-One</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=146&annotation=84E26XR2) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">There is no doubt that at this point in history the neurotic, the pervert, and the  psychotic cannot be adequately defined in terms of drives, for drives are simply the  desiring-machines themselves. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=146&annotation=CTIIT8DV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">According to Freud and Lacan, the neurotic, the pervert, and the psychotic  are understood in terms of drives, which Deleuze and Guattari view as  purely desiring-machines. However, interpreting these figures solely through the lens of desiring-machines overlooks the territories they inhabit.</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=146&annotation=VEICNR6E) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">They must be defined in terms of modern territorialities. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=147&annotation=IGPI38Q2) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The neurotic is trapped within the residual or artificial territorialities of our  society, and reduces all of them (les rabat toutes) to Oedipus as the ultimate  territoriality ‚Äî as reconstructed in the analyst‚Äôs office and projected upon the full  body of the psychoanalyst (yes, my boss is my father, and so is the Chief of State,  and so are you, Doctor). (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=147&annotation=FHBHIYME) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The neurotic is ensnared by the artificial territorialities produced by  society, reducing everything to Oedipus as the ultimate territoriality; they  are projected onto the psychoanalyst‚Äôs entire being. In this way, the neurotic  is confined to the roles society has imposed, with desire restricted,  regulated, and channeled into these predefined structures.</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=147&annotation=8A6UTX6L) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The pervert is someone who takes the artifice seriously and plays the game to the  hilt: if you want them, you can have them ‚Äî territorialities infinitely more  artificial than the ones that society offers us, totally artificial new families, secret  lunar societies. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=147&annotation=QWY929TZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Unlike the neurotic, who passively becomes trapped within these roles, the  pervert actively engages with the game, deriving pleasure from pushing  these artificial territories to their extreme.</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=147&annotation=CKULWIC7)

<mark class="hltr-blue">As for the schizo, continually wandering about, migrating here, there, and  everywhere as best [the schizo] can, [the schizo] plunges further and further into  the realm of deterritorialization, reaching the furthest limits of the decomposition  of the socius on the surface of [their] own body without organs. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=148&annotation=FGEWW6CH) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Unlike the pervert, the schizo aims to completely reject and escape these  artificial territorialities. The schizo roams the body without organs, striving  to push beyond the limits imposed upon them and to create pure potentiality  on their body without organs. The schizo is not bound to any single territory  as they are constantly in a state of migration.</mark> [Page 148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=148&annotation=9D39PA66) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">It may well be that these peregrinations are the schizo‚Äôs own particular way of  rediscovering the earth. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=149&annotation=T3X4FM3Y) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The schizophrenic deliberately seeks out the very limit of capitalism: [the  schizophrenic] is its inherent tendency brought to fulfillment, its surplus product,  its proletariat, and its exterminating angel. [The schizophrenic] scrambles all the  codes and is the transmitter of the decoded flows of desire. The real continues to  flow. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=149&annotation=QHEI9R8V) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the schizophrenic plays a crucial role in the  perpetuation and production of capitalism. By decoding flows, the  schizophrenic ‚Äúseeks out the very limit of capitalism,‚Äù thereby pushing the  boundaries of capital further. This means that we should be weary of a  common misreading of Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs work. Deleuze and Guattari  are not implying that schizophrenia is liberatory or revolutionary here.</mark> [Page 149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=149&annotation=56DAJZL6) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What must be noted here is that capitalism‚Äôs decoding of flows occurs  through a schizophrenia as a process of production (with the transmitter of  this decoding being the schizophrenic).</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=150&annotation=6MVBYAVJ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In the schizo, the two aspects of process are conjoined: the metaphysical process  that puts us in contact with the ‚Äúdemoniacal‚Äù element in nature or within the  heart of the earth, and the historical process of social production that restores the  autonomy of desiring-machines in relation to the deterritorialized social machine.  (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=150&annotation=HCUMKWNZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Both of these processes appear to be emblematic of desiring-production and  social production whereby the difference lies in terms of r√©gime. The first  process is concerned with a metaphysical process, concerned with  eradicating the dichotomy between human and the ‚Äúdemoniacal‚Äù element in  nature. The second process is concerned with homo historia whereby  desiring-machines have autonomy and are unleashed from being regulated  and channeled in a particular manner dependent upon the socius in which  they are constituted.</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=150&annotation=LHZJB7FG) 

- [N] Neurosis, perversion, and psychosis are best understood in terms of how they relate to modern artificial territorialities, not just drives.
- [N] The neurotic is trapped by artificial territorialities, reducing them all to the Oedipal framework.
- [N] The pervert actively engages with and manipulates artificial territorialities, creating their own extreme versions.
- [N] The schizo plunges into deterritorialization, seeking to escape artificial territories and connect with the Body without Organs and the "demoniacal" in nature.
- [N] The schizophrenic embodies capitalism's deterritorializing tendency, acting as its limit, surplus product, and transmitter of decoded flows.
- [N] Schizophrenia combines a metaphysical process (connecting to nature/earth) with a historical process (restoring desiring-machine autonomy in the deterritorialized social machine).

> This section differentiates the neurotic, pervert, and schizophrenic not by their drives but by their relationship to modern artificial territorialities. The neurotic is trapped within these, reducing them to the Oedipal. The pervert actively plays with and exaggerates them. The schizophrenic seeks radical deterritorialization, attempting to escape these structures and connect with the Body without Organs. The schizophrenic is presented as embodying capitalism's inherent deterritorializing tendency, constantly pushing its limit.

### Schizophrenia as the Limit of Social Production

<mark class="hltr-blue">Schizophrenia is desiring-production as the limit of social production. (AO, 35;  emphasis mine)</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=151&annotation=9X6FGXQX) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Does capitalism produce schizophrenia or  does schizophrenia produce capitalism? But why stop with this question?  Might capitalism and schizophrenia be interdependently related? ... Or, more  precisely, is schizophrenia just the limit of any social production, to which  capitalism has a unique relationship with because of its tendency towards this  limit?</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=151&annotation=RYIDTG3G) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Desiring-production, and its difference in regime as compared to social  production, are thus end points, not points of departure. (AO, 35; emphasis  mine)</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=152&annotation=6MIGDDBE) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the difference in r√©gime between desiringproduction and social production cannot be understood by viewing them as  separate starting points. Instead, it is at an ‚Äúend point‚Äù that the distinction  between the two becomes clear. Only when capitalism nears its ultimate  limit ‚Äî when it begins ‚Äúbreaking down‚Äù under its own contradictions ‚Äî can  we clearly distinguish between capitalism and schizophrenia. This is  because only schizophrenia is capable of pushing the limit of capital  further. Schizophrenia is a decoding and deterritorialization of the flows of  desire that serves as a process of capitalism; however, these flows inevitably  become contained through capitalism‚Äôs recording and reterritorialization  which serves to maintain the limit of capital. Therefore, the distinction  between these two forms of production is found at an endpoint.</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=152&annotation=6CLY8X9B) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">capitalism and schizophrenia are  interdependent, with one producing the other; and this produces reality:</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=152&annotation=L7I69PKS) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Between the two there is nothing but an ongoing process of becoming that is the  becoming of reality. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=152&annotation=995SHMQZ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">And if materialist psychiatry may be defined as the psychiatry that introduces the  concept of production into consideration of the problem of desire, it cannot avoid  posing in eschatological terms the problem of the ultimate relationship between the  analytic machine, the revolutionary machine, and desiring-machines. (AO, 35)</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=153&annotation=XP563AYX) 

- [N] Schizophrenia is defined as desiring-production at the limit of social production.
- [N] The relationship between desiring-production and social production, including their difference in r√©gime, is best understood not from their origins but from their "end points" or limits, particularly as capitalism approaches its schizophrenic limit.
- [N] Capitalism and schizophrenia are interdependent, mutually producing reality through their ongoing process of becoming.
- [N] Materialist psychiatry, by introducing production into the problem of desire, must consider the eschatological relationship between the analytic machine, the revolutionary machine, and desiring-machines.

> This concluding section posits schizophrenia as desiring-production specifically at the limit of social production. The distinction between desiring-production and social production, despite their fundamental unity, becomes clearest at their "end points" or limits. Capitalism's inherent tendency towards its schizophrenic limit highlights this relationship. The ongoing process of becoming between desiring-production and social production constitutes the becoming of reality itself. Materialist psychiatry, focused on production, must ultimately confront the relationship between different "machines" (analytic, revolutionary, desiring) in terms of ultimate transformation.

### Quick Recap

<mark class="hltr-green">Capitalism decodes flows of desire, constantly creating new possibilities to  increase productivity and generate surplus value. This makes capitalism a  highly creative and innovative system, continually pushing the limit of  capital forward to sustain itself. However, if capitalism were to allow these  decoded flows of desire ‚Äî this schizophrenia ‚Äî to have free rein, it would  collapse, as capitalism needs boundaries to maintain its structure. To  prevent this, capitalism must recode these flows, channeling desire back  into socially productive forms (like the family, the state, and various artificial identities), thereby maintaining the limits of capital and ensuring  its continued reproduction.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=154&annotation=7DLIS97H) 

<mark class="hltr-green">capitalism produces the schizophrenic subject because it  requires schizophrenia as a way to resolve its own contradictions. Capitalism  requires a creative force to continually generate surplus value amid its  inherent contradictions. However, if left unchecked, the schizophrenic  subject would no longer feel the need to conform to the artificial territory of  capital ‚Äî they would no longer adhere to the societal structures that sustain  the system. Therefore, capitalism must recode these flows of desire,  producing artificial identities that promote endless consumption within  capitalism. These artificial identities, however, are simultaneously decoded  by the schizo, who constantly pushes against the boundaries and constraints  that capitalism seeks to enforces. This process of decoding and recoding  happens in one fell swoop, akin to Marx‚Äôs law of counteracted tendency;  allowing the system to move forward amidst its contradictions.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=154&annotation=6GWRNBNF) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The implication of capitalism necessitating decoding and recoding means  something very important: contradiction is built into the system.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/94R5B2A3?page=154&annotation=UP4H53IU) 

- [N] Capitalism decodes desire flows, creating possibilities and surplus value, pushing the limit of capital.
- [N] Capitalism must recode these flows into artificial territorialities (family, state, etc.) to prevent collapse and maintain its structure.
- [N] Capitalism produces the schizophrenic subject as a figure that both generates capital (via decoding/deterritorialization) and pushes against capital's limits, embodying the system's inherent contradiction (decoding vs. recoding).
- [N] This decoding/recoding mirrors Marx's law of the counteracted tendency and highlights contradiction built into capitalism.

> This recap summarizes the key point that capitalism's process of decoding desire flows (schizophrenic tendency) generates energy and surplus value but must be counteracted by artificial recoding into established social forms to prevent collapse and maintain the limit of capital. Capitalism produces the schizophrenic subject, who embodies both its deterritorializing drive and its counter-tendency, revealing the system's inherent contradiction. This constant decoding and recoding allows capitalism to perpetuate itself.
