### Preface: From Lewis Carroll to the Stoics

<mark class="hltr-yellow">this theory is inseparable from paradoxes: sense is a nonexisting entity, and, in fact, maintains very special relations with nonsense.</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=12&annotation=W67QU5A3) 

<mark class="hltr-purple">Preface: From Lewis Carroll to the Stoics</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=12&annotation=ZMHTNEZC) 
- [N] ðŸ¤–: Imagine trying to build a model of the human body.

    *   You easily see and model bones (Denotation - solid structure).
    *   You easily see and model muscles moving (Manifestation - visible action).
    *   You use concepts like "circulation" or "respiration" (Signification - conceptual systems).

    Now, do you add "life force"?

    *   You can't just see "life force" from the outside like a bone. It's "evanescent."
    *   Should your model only include what's obvious from the outside?
    *   Or should your model be built philosophically from within, such that it requires a concept like "life" or "vitality" for the parts (bones, muscles, etc.) to make sense as a living system, even if "life force" itself isn't a visible object?

    Deleuze is arguing for the second approach regarding Sense. His model of language needs Sense for its internal coherence, even if Sense is elusive to direct observation. 
- [N] Deleuze introduces his theory of sense, which is inseparable from paradox and has a special relationship with nonsense.

> The preface introduces the core idea of the book: a theory of sense that is paradoxical, a non-existent entity, and intimately connected with nonsense. It sets the stage by referencing sources like Lewis Carroll and the Stoics, suggesting the exploration will involve logic and language games as much as philosophical concepts.

### First Series of Paradoxes of Pure Becoming

<mark class="hltr-purple">First Series of Paradoxes of Pure Becoming</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=15&annotation=Q7MXWRZF) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good sense affirms that in all things there is a determinable sense or direction (sens); but paradox is the affirmation of both senses or directions at the same time.</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=15&annotation=H7WE2RNG) 
- [N] ie "When I say "Alice becomes larger", she is larger now; she was smaller before. But it is at the same moment that one becomes larger than one was and smaller than one becomes." 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Pure becoming, the unlimited, is the matter of the simulacrum insofar as it eludes the action of the Idea and insofar as it contests both model and copy at once.</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=16&annotation=DKIQAIM3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The paradox of this pure becoming, with its capacity to elude the present, is the paradox of infinite identity (the infinite identity of both directions or senses at the same time-of future and past, of the day h(Â·fonÂ· and th(â€¢ day after, of more and less, of two much and not enough, of actiw and passiw, and of cause and effect). It is language which fixes th(â€¢ limits (the moment, for exampl(', at which the excess</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=16&annotation=GNQ7MTLW) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">begins), but it is language as well which transcends the limits and restores them to the infinite equivalence of an unlimited becoming ("A red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and ... if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds").</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=17&annotation=QVZ3PRBX) 

<mark class="hltr-green">which way, which way?" asks Alice, sensing that it is always in both directions at the same time, so that for once she stays the same, through an optical illusion; the reversal of the day before and the day after, the present always being eluded-"jam tomorrow and jam yesterday-but never jam to-day''; the reversal of more and less: five nights are five times hotter than a single one, "but they must be five times as cold for the same reason"; the reversal of active and passive: "do cats eat bats?" is as good as "do bats eat cats?"; the reversal of cause and effect: to be punished before having committed a fault, to cry before having pricked oneself, to serve before having divided up the servings.</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=17&annotation=CZZZK6L2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus the personal self requires God and the world in general. But when substantives and adjectives begin to dissolve, when the names of pause and rest are carried away by the verbs of pure becoming and slide into the language of events, all identity disappears from the self, the world, and God.</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=17&annotation=HIC2RHP8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Paradox is initially that which destroys good sense as the only direction, but it is also that which destroys common sense as the assignation of fixed identities.</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=17&annotation=KCP3TNJA) 
- [N] Pure becoming is paradoxical because it affirms opposite directions simultaneously.
- [N] Pure becoming is the material of the simulacrum.
- [N] The paradox of pure becoming is infinite identity (both directions at once).
- [N] Language both fixes limits and transcends them in unlimited becoming.
- [N] When language dissolves fixed identities (nouns, adjectives) into verbs of becoming, identity disappears from self, world, and God.
- [N] Paradox destroys both good sense (single direction) and common sense (fixed identities).

> The first series explores the paradoxes inherent in "pure becoming," where things are simultaneously moving in opposite directions (e.g., becoming larger and smaller at the same moment). This unlimited, paradoxical becoming is linked to the simulacrum and challenges conventional notions of good sense (single direction) and common sense (fixed identities), suggesting that when language focuses on events and verbs of becoming, traditional identities dissolve.

### Second Series of Paradoxes of Surface Effects

<mark class="hltr-purple">Second Series of Paradoxes of Surface Effects</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=18&annotation=YDEIWR4U) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">First, there are bodies with their tensions, physical qualities, actions and passions, and the corresponding "states of affairs." These states of affairs, actions and passions, are determined by the mixtures of bodies.</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=18&annotation=D6VJ6GBE) 
- [N] Bodies 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But to the degree that there is a unity of bodies among themselves, to the degree that there is a unity of active and passive principles, a cosmic present embraces the entire universe: only bodies exist in space, and only the present exists in time. There are no causes and effects among bodies. Rather, all bodies are causes-causes in relation to each other and for each other. In the scope of the cosmic present, the unity is called Destiny.</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=18&annotation=34C38KFQ) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Second, all boditÂ·s are causes in relation to each other, and causes for each other-but causes of what? They are causes of certain things of an entirely different nature. These ~/Teets anÂ· not boditÂ·s, but, properly speaking, "inrnrporl'al" mtitil's. Thl'y ar(' not physical qualities and</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=18&annotation=ARXARFW9) 
- [N] ... 

<mark class="hltr-orange">properties, but rather logical or dialectical attributes. They are not things or facts, but events.</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=19&annotation=JCYL7QWF) 
- [N] Events 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus time must be grasped twice, in two complementary though mutually exclusive fashions. first, it must be grasped entirely as the living present in bodies which act and are acted upon. Second, it must be grasped entirely as an entity infinitely divisible into past and future, and into the incorporeal effects which result from bodies, their actions and their passions. Only the present exists in time and gathers together or absorbs the past and future. But only the past and future inhere in time and divide each present infinitely. These are not three successive dimensions, but two simultaneous readings of time.</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=19&annotation=IQSVXQPG) 
- [N] Time 

<mark class="hltr-blue">[The Stoics distinguished] radically two planes of being, something that no one had done before them: on the one hand, real and profound being, force; on the other, the plane of facts, which frolic on the surface of being, and constitute an endless multiplicity of incorporeal beings.</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=19&annotation=URT2488V) 
- [N] Two planes of being: force/bodies and facts/events 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But what we mean by "to grow," "to diminish," "to become red," "to become green," "to cut," and "to be cut," etc., is something entirely different. These are no longer states of affairs-mixtures deep inside bodies-but incorporeal events at the surface which are the results of these mixtures.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=20&annotation=VRWXJC8N) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Incorporeal effects are never themselves causes in relation to each other; rather, they are only "quasi-causes" following laws which perhaps express in each case the relative unity or mixture of bodies on which they depend for their real causes.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=20&annotation=JIXR5I4X) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus freedom is preserved in two complementary manners: once in the interiority of destiny as a connection between causes, and once more in the exteriority of events as a bond of effects. For this reason the Stoics can oppose destiny and necessity.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=20&annotation=7HVIGHRK) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">this split always refers us back to language, either to the existence of a declension of causes or, as we shall see, to the existence of a conju9ation of effects.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=20&annotation=RQABTNZ8) 
- [N] Splitting of causal relation 
- [N] Bodies (physical states of affairs) are causes of incorporeal effects (events, attributes).
- [N] Events are results of bodily mixtures, existing at the surface, distinct from the bodies themselves.
- [N] Events are quasi-causes of other events, not real causes like bodies.
- [N] Time has two readings: the present of bodies (Chronos) and the past/future of incorporeal events (Aion).
- [N] The Stoics distinguished two planes of being: bodies (depth, force) and incorporeal effects/events (surface, facts).
- [N] Freedom exists in both the causal connection of bodies (destiny) and the bond of effects/events (exteriority).
- [N] The distinction between corporeal causes and incorporeal effects refers back to language (declension of causes, conjugation of effects).

> This section elaborates on the Stoic distinction between physical bodies and their actions/passions (existing in a temporal present and acting as real causes) and incorporeal events or effects (existing at the surface and in the unlimited time of the Aion, acting as quasi-causes). This fundamental duality establishes a frontier between things and events, bodies and language, and introduces a split in causality.

### Third Series of the Proposition

<mark class="hltr-purple">Third Series of the Proposition</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=26&annotation=TVUBRASV) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The first is called denotation or indication: it is the relation of the proposition to an external state of affairs (datum). The state of affairs is individuated; it includes particular bodies, mixtures of bodies, qualities, quantities, and relations. Denotation functions through the association of the words themselves with particular images which ouaht to "represent" the state of affairs.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=26&annotation=5ALINXQ3) 
- [N] First distinct relation within propositions: Denotation 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The denotating intuition is then expressed by the form: "it is that," or "it is not that."</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=26&annotation=FMH2C7CH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It would be wrong to treat them as universal concepts, for they are formal particulars (sinauliers) which function as pure "designators" or, as Benveniste says, indexicals (indicateurs). These formal indexicals are: this, that, it, here, there, yesterday, now, etc. Proper names are also indexicals or designators, but they have special impor-tance since they alone form properly material singularities.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=27&annotation=TEKMFFEE) 
- [N] this, that, it, here, there, yesterday, now, etc. 

<mark class="hltr-orange">A second relation of the proposition is often called "manifestation." It concerns the relation of the proposition to the person who speaks and expresses himself. Manifestation therefore is presented as a statement of desires and beliefs which correspond to the proposition. Desires and beliefs are causal inferences, not associations. Desire is the internal causality of an image with respect to the existence of the object or the corresponding state of affairs. Correlatively, belief is the anticipation of this object or state of affairs insofar as its existence must be produced by an external causality.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=27&annotation=2SZTAT7P) 
- [N] Second distinct relation within propositions: Manifestation 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">it makes denotation possible, and inferences form a systematic unity from which the associations derive.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=27&annotation=W72QYV2Q) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The primacy of manifestation is confirmed by linguistic analysis, which reveals that there are in the proposition "manifesters" like the special particles I, you, tomorrow, always, elsewhere, everywhere, etc. In the same way that the proper name is a privileged indicator, "I" is the basic manifester. But it is not only the other manifesters which depend on the "!": all indicators are related to it as well.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=27&annotation=V3NREYEK) 
- [N] I, you, tomorrow, always, elsewhere, everywhere, etc. 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">denotation to manifestation, a displacement of logical values occun which is represented by the Cogito: no longer the true and the false, but veracity and illusion. In his celebrated analysis of the piece of wax, for example, Descartes is not at all looking for that which was dwelling in the wax-this problem is not even formulated in this text; rather, he shows how the I, manifest in the Cogito, grounds the judgment of denotation by which the wax is identified.</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=28&annotation=SVINE82A) 
- [N] The Cogito (I think) is the starting point, not denotation (true/false), but manifestation (veracity/illusion), rather relationship between language/thought and the self. Certainty of the self offers the ground which truth, certainty of the world is built. 

<mark class="hltr-orange">We ought to reserve the term "signification" for a third dimension of the proposition. Here it is a question of the relation of the word to universal or 9eneral concepts, and of syntactic connections to the impli-cations of the concept.</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=28&annotation=52HAA5IF) 
- [N] Third distinct relation within propositions: Signification 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Signification is defined by this order of conceptual implication where the proposition under consideration intervenes only as an element of a "demonstration," in the most general sense of the word, that is, either as premise or as conclusion. Thus, "implies" and "therefore" are essentially linguistic signifiers. "Implication" is the sign which defines the relation between premises and conclusion; "therefore" is the sign of assertion, which defines the possibility of affirming the conclusion itself as the outcome of implications.</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=28&annotation=X4F5HX8W) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Demonstration must not be understood in a restricted, syllogistic or mathematical sense, but also in the physical sense of probabilities or in the moral sense of promises and commitments. In this last case, the assertion of the conclusion is represented by the moment the promise is effectively kept. 2</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4F5HX8W?page=28&annotation=X2TU36GQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the condition ef truth, the aggregate of conditions under which the proposition "would be" true.</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=28&annotation=8AV6TLHG) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For if manifestation itself is primary in relation to denotation, if it is the foundation, it is so only from a very specific point of view. To borrow a classic distinction, we say that it is from the standpoint of speech (parole), be it a speech that is silent. In the order of speech, it is the I which begins, and begins absolutely. In this order, therefore, the I is primary, not only in relation to all possible denotations which are founded upon it, but also in relation to the significations which it envelops. But precisely from this standpoint, conceptual significations are neither valid nor deployed for themselves: they are only implied (though not expressed) by the I, presenting itself as having signification which is immediately understood and identical to its own manifestation.</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=29&annotation=9WZN2J4G) 
- [N] Primacy of manifestation in speech 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But if another domain exists in which significations are valid and developed for themselves, significations would be primary in it and would provide the basis of manifestation. This domain is precisely that of language (langue). In it, a proposition is able to appear only as a premise or a conclusion, signifying concepts before manifesting a subject, or even before denoting a state of affairs. It is from this point of view that signified concepts, such as God or the world, are always primary in relation to the self as manifested person and to things as designated objects.</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=29&annotation=Z6KLMGVN) 
- [N] Primacy of signification in language 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the conclusion can be detached from the premises, but only on the condition that one always adds other premises from which alone the conclusion is not detachable.</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=30&annotation=22J7YUEH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">circle of the proposition.</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=31&annotation=NLNTTCWB) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Whether we ought to be content with these three dimensions of the proposition, or whether we should add afourth-which would be sense-is an economic or strategic question. It is not that we must construct an a posteriori model corresponding to previous dimensions, but rather the model itself must have the aptitude to function a priori from within, were it forced to introduce a supplementary dimension which, because of its evanescence, could not have been recognized in experience from outside.</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=31&annotation=BQ8PXZXY) 
- [N] ðŸ¤–: Imagine trying to build a model of the human body.

    *   You easily see and model bones (Denotation - solid structure).
    *   You easily see and model muscles moving (Manifestation - visible action).
    *   You use concepts like "circulation" or "respiration" (Signification - conceptual systems).

    Now, do you add "life force"?

    *   You can't just see "life force" from the outside like a bone. It's "evanescent."

    Deleuze is arguing for the second approach regarding Sense. His model of language needs Sense for its internal coherence, even if Sense is elusive to direct observation. 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is undeniable that all denotation presupposes sense, and that we position ourselves strai9ht away within sense whenever we denote.</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=31&annotation=9AMLM4WT) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If these significations collapse, or are not established in themselves, personal identity is lost, as Alice painfully experiences, in conditions where God, the world, and the self become the blurred characters of the dream of someone who is poorly determined.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=32&annotation=U3TZ9EU8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">signification can never exercise its role of last foundation, since it presupposes an irreducible denotation.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=32&annotation=RQ7EHDHQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">One is perpetually referred from the conditioned to the condition, and also from the condition to the conditioned. ror the condition of truth to avoid this defect, it ought to have an element of its own, distinct from the form of the conditioned. It ought to have somethin9 uncond1tioned capable of assuring a real genesis of denotation and of the other dimensions of the proposition. Thus the condition of truth would be defined no longer as the form of conceptual possibility, but rather as ideational material or "stratum," that is to say, no longer as signification, but rather as sense.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=33&annotation=CXKK4MHZ) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Sense is the fourth dimension of the proposition. The Stoics discovered it along with the event: sense, the expressed <!{ the proposition, is an incorporeal, complex, and irreducible entity, at the surface of things, a pure event which inheres or subsists in the proposition.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=33&annotation=IA95TGCH) 
- [N] Fourth distinct relation within propositions: Sense 
- [N] Propositions have three traditional dimensions: denotation (relation to state of affairs, truth/falsehood), manifestation (relation to the speaker, veracity/illusion), and signification (relation to concepts, implication/assertion).
- [N] Manifestation is primary in speech ("I" is basic manifester), while signification is primary in language ("God," "world" concepts).
- [N] Denotation relies on indexicals and proper names.
- [N] Manifestation relies on manifesters like "I", "you".
- [N] Signification relies on logical operators like "implies," "therefore".
- [N] The relationships between these dimensions can be seen as circular.
- [N] A fourth dimension, Sense, is needed for a complete model of the proposition, acting as an unconditioned element for their genesis.
- [N] Sense, as discovered by the Stoics, is the incorporeal, complex, irreducible expressed of the proposition, a pure event at the surface of things.

> This section introduces the traditional three dimensions of a proposition: denotation (relating words to things/states of affairs), manifestation (relating the proposition to the speaker's beliefs/desires), and signification (relating words to concepts and implications). It argues that these dimensions form a circle, requiring a fourth dimension, Sense, as an unconditioned element (an incorporeal event at the surface) to ground their genesis.

### Fourth Series of Dualities

<mark class="hltr-purple">Fourth Series of Dualities</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=37&annotation=9H32MKQL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">ft is by following the border, by skirting the surface, that one passes from bodies to the incorporeal.</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=24&annotation=Q2ASW7MM) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">"the substance of things hoped for, and the existence of things not seen."</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=25&annotation=JSJRNPGV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The continuity between reverse and right side replaces all the levels of depth; and the surface effects in one and the same Event, which would hold for all events, bring to language becom-ing and its paradoxes.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=25&annotation=7AEYLQ73) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sense is that which is expressed.</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=34&annotation=B662MKU5) 

<mark class="hltr-green">In truth, the attempt to make this fourth dimension evident is a little like Carroll's Snark hunt. Perhaps the dimension is the hunt itself, and sense is the Snark. It is difficult to respond to those who wish to be satisfied with words, things, images, and ideas. For we may not even say that sense exists either in things or in the mind; it has neither physical nor mental existence. Shall we at least say that it is useful, and that it is necessary to admit it for its utility? Not even this, since it is endowed with an inefficacious, impassive, and sterile splendor. This is why we said that in fact we can only infer it indirectly, on the basis of the circle where the ordinary dimensions of the proposition lead us. It is only by breaking open the circle, as in the case of the Mobius strip, by unfolding and untwisting it, that the dimension of sense appears for itself, in its irreducibility, and also in its genetic power as it animates an a priori internal model of the proposition.'Â° The logic of sense is inspired in its entirety by empiricism. Only empiricism knows how to transcend the experiential dimensions of the visible without falling into Ideas, and how to track down, invoke, and perhaps produce a phantom at the limit of a lengthened or unfolded experience.</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=34&annotation=63BLU7PA) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There are many noemata or senses for the same denotatum: evening star and morning star are two noemata, that is, two ways in which the same denotatum may be presented in expressions.</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=34&annotation=UGS64B78) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The noema is not given in a perception (nor in a recollection or an image). It has an entirely different status which consists in not existing outside the proposition which expresses it-whether the proposition is perceptual, or whether it is imaginative, recollective, or representative.</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=35&annotation=BMUZIWUC) 
- [N] Noema is the pure event of what is expressed, existing on the surface 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Let us consider the complex status of sense or of that which is expressed. On one hand, it does not exist outside the proposition which expresses it; what is expressed does not exist outside its expression. This is why we cannot say that sense exists, but rather that it inheres or subsists. On the other hand, it does not merge at all with the proposi-tion, for it has an objective (objectite) which is quite distinct. What is expressed has no resemblance whatsoever to the expression.</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=35&annotation=PMPBKCNY) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Sense is both the expressible or the expressed ef the proposition, and the attribute ef the state of effairs. It turns one side toward things and one side toward propositions. But it does not merge with the proposition which expresses it any more than with the state of affairs or the quality which the proposition denotes. It is exactly the boundary between propositions and things. It is this aliquid at once extra-Being and inherence, that is, this minimum of being which befits inherences. 12 It is in this sense that it is an "event": on the condition that the event is not confused with its spatio-temporal realization in a state ef affairs. We will not ask therefore what is the sense of the event: the event is sense itself. The event belongs essentially to language; it has an essential relationship to language. But language is what is said of things.</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=36&annotation=PN8L3SH9) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The eve.nt subsists in language, but it happens to things. Things and propositions are less in a situation of radical duality and more on the two sides of a frontier represented by sense. This frontier does not mingle or reunite them (for there is no more monism here than dualism); it is rather something along the line of an articulation of their difference: body/ language. Comparing the event to a mist rising over the prairie, we could say that this mist rises precisely at the frontier, at the juncture of things and propositions. As a result, the duality is reflected from both sides and in each of the two terms. On the side of the thing, there are physical qualities and real relations which constitute the state of affairs; there are also ideational logical attributes which indicate incor-poreal events. And on the side of the proposition, there are names and adjectives which denote the state of affairs; and also there are verbs which express events or logical attributes. On one hand, there are singular proper names, substantives, and general adjectives which indi-cate limits, pauses, rests, and presences; on the other, there are verbs carrying off with them becoming and its train of reversible events and infinitely dividing their present into past and future.</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=38&annotation=KHVVKIPA) 
- [N] The mist over the prairie, sense 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To pass to the other side of the mirror is to pass from the relation of denotation to the relation of expression-without pausing at the intermediaries, namely, at manifestation and signification. It is to reach a region where language no longer has any relation to that which it denotes, but only to that which it expresses, that is, to sense. This is the final displacement of the duality: it has now moved inside the proposition.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=39&annotation=ATK4M9YL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">in many of Carroll's poems, one wit-nesses the autonomous development of two simultaneous dimensions, one referring to denoted objects which are always consumable or recipients of consumption, the other referring to always expressible meanings or at least to objects which are the bearers of language and sense. These two dimensions converge only in an esoteric word, in a non-identifiable aliquid. Take, for example, the refrain of the Snark: "They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; I They pursued it with forks and hope"-where the "thimble" and "fork" refer to designated instruments, but "hope" and "care" to considerations of sense and events (sense, in Carroll's works, is often presented as that which one must "take care of," the object of a fundamental "care"). The strange word "Snark" is the frontier which is stretched as it is drawn by both series.</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=40&annotation=CJ97UG88) 
- [N] "They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; I They pursued it with forks and hope"
- [N] Sense is that which is expressed by the proposition.
- [N] Sense is an incorporeal entity that inheres or subsists in the proposition, distinct from both the proposition and the state of affairs it denotes.
- [N] Sense acts as the boundary or frontier between propositions and things/states of affairs.
- [N] Sense is an "aliquid" (something), existing as extra-Being and inherence, a minimum of being.
- [N] Sense is itself the event, not something the event has.
- [N] The event/sense belongs to language and relates to what is said of things.
- [N] The duality of body/language or things/propositions is articulated by the surface of sense, which reflects the duality on both sides (e.g., qualities/attributes, names/verbs).
- [N] Sense allows passing from denotation to expression, reaching a level where language relates only to what it expresses.
- [N] Sense can be seen as a frontier (like the Snark) between distinct dimensions (denotation/expression, things/meanings).

> The fourth series delves deeper into the nature of Sense as an incorporeal entity that is the "expressed" of the proposition and the "attribute" of the state of affairs. It acts as a boundary or frontier between things and propositions, not merging them but articulating their difference at the surface. Sense is likened to a mist or a phantom, difficult to grasp directly but necessary for the genesis of propositional dimensions.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sense is like the sphere in which I am already established in order to enact possible denotations, and even to think their conditions. Sense is always presupposed as soon as I begin to speak; I would not be able to begin without this presupposition. In other words, I never state the sense of what I am saying. But on the other hand, I can always take the sense of what I say as the object of another proposition whose sense, in turn, I cannot state. I thus enter into the infinite regress of that which is presupposed.</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=42&annotation=RBRJFTQS)

The song is called 'Ways and Means': but that's only what it's called, you know!"-"Well, what is the song then?" said Alice, who was by this time completely bewildered.-"! was coming to that," the Knight said.

This two-term regress is the minimal condition of indefinite proliferation.</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=44&annotation=P6K9KJI7) 
- [N] Sense is always presupposed when we speak, but its own sense cannot be stated within the same proposition.
- [N] This leads to an infinite regress, where the sense of a proposition becomes the object of another proposition, ad infinitum.
- [N] The regress can be simplified to an alternation between a name denoting a thing and a name denoting the sense of that name.

> This section introduces the paradox of indefinite proliferation or regress: sense is always presupposed in speech, but cannot be stated directly; attempting to state the sense of a proposition leads to another proposition whose sense must also be presupposed, creating an infinite chain, exemplified by Carroll's "Haddock's Eyes" dialogue.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sense is always a double sense and excludes the possibility that there may be a "good sense" in the relation. Events are never causes of one another, but rather enter the relations of quasi-causality, an unreal and ghostly causality, endlessly reappearing in the two senses.

- [N] Sense is always a "double sense," going in two directions at once, unlike "good sense" which has only one direction.
- [N] Events relate through quasi-causality, not real causality, appearing in both senses (e.g., becoming older/younger at the same time).
- [N] Sense is the "third state of essence," distinct from essence as signified (concept) or designated (particular thing).
- [N] Sense is indifferent to all opposites (universal/singular, etc.) because these belong to the propositional dimensions of denotation and signification, not sense itself.

> This section explores the paradox of neutrality: sense is indifferent to the logical and ontological oppositions (like affirmation/negation, universal/singular) that characterize propositions and things. It operates as a "double sense" or quasi-causality that goes in both directions at once, establishing Sense as a neutral "third estate" distinct from the essences grasped by signification and denotation.

### Sixth Series on Serialization

<mark class="hltr-purple">Sixth Series on Serialization</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=50&annotation=IA2ZM94Z) 
- [N] #ðŸ”¥ Love this chapter. There are some incredible literary devices to be learned through playing with series. 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The paradox of indefinite regress is the one from which all the other paradoxes are derived. Now, regress has, necessarily, a serial form: each denoting name has a sense which must be denoted by another name: n 1 ~ n 2 ~ n 3 ~ n4 â€¢â€¢â€¢</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=50&annotation=I7HW4K94) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But if, instead of considering the simple succession of names, we consider that which alternates in this succession, we see that each name is taken first in the denotation which it brings about, and then in the sense which it expresses, because it is this sense which serves as the denotation of the other name.</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=50&annotation=DSWQ7QJ5) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the serial form is necessarily realized in the simultaneity ef at least two series.</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=50&annotation=QUN9X4CG) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Alice is the story of an oral resress, but "regress" must be understood first in a logical sense, as the synthesis of names. The homogeneous form of this synthesis subsumes under it two heterogeneous series of orality: to eat/to speak, consumable things/expressible senses. The serial form itself therefore refers us to the already described paradoxes of duality and forces us to address them again from this new point of view.</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=51&annotation=KQGZG9KV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The same duality, we have seen, occurs outside, between events and states of affairs; at the suiface, between propositions and denoted objects; and inside the proposition between expressions and denotations.</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=51&annotation=UBTF2FAZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The law governing two simultaneous series is that they are never equal. One represents the signifier, the other the signified.</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4MDSX898?page=51&annotation=4MDSX898) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We call "signifier" any sign which presents in itself an aspect of sense; we call "signified," on the contrary, that which serves as the correlative to this aspect of sense, that is, that which is defined in a duality relative to this aspect. What is signified therefore is never sense itself. In a restrained sense, signified is the concept; in an extended sense, signified is any thing which may be defined on the basis of the distinction that a certain aspect of sense establishes with this thing.</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=51&annotation=H39L9M56) 
- [N] Signified is the concept, or the thing the sense establishes with. Signifier is the event 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">it is always the case that one series has the role of the signifier, and the other the role of the signified, even if tht'se roles are interchanged as we change points of view.</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=52&annotation=C227EXVG) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Jacques Lacan has brought to light the existence of two series in one of Edgar Allan Poe's stories. First series: the king who does not see the compromising letter received by his wife; the queen who is relieved to have hidden it so cleverly by leaving it out in the open; the minister who sees everything and takes possession of the letter. Second series: the police who find nothing at the minister's hotel; the minister who thought of leaving the letter in the open in order better to hide it; Dupin who sees everything and takes back possession of the letter.</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=52&annotation=PE369E4T) 
- [N] Love this serialization of parallel stories. Other interesting literary, artistic examples are derailed in this chapter #ðŸ’¡ 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the essential appears when small or great differences predominate over resemblances and become pri-mary; in other words, when two quite distinct stories are developed simultaneously, or when the characters have a vacillating and ill-determined identity.</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=52&annotation=NFACUUP6) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">first, the terms of each series are in perpetual relative displacement in relation to those of the other (thus, for example, the position occupied by the minister in Poe's two series). There is an essential lack of correspondence.</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=53&annotation=QU82WATU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is thus a double sliding of one series over or under the other, which constitutes both, in a perpetual disequilibrium vis-a-vis each other.</mark> [Page 54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=54&annotation=4LRRNPJ5) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Second, this disequilibrium must itself be oriented: one of the two series -the one determined as signifying, to be precise, presents an excess over the other. For there is always a blurred excess of signifier.</mark> [Page 54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=54&annotation=8889CXB8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Finally, we reach the most important point, a very special and paradoxical case, which ensures the relative displacement of the two series, the excess of the one over the other, without being reducible to any of the terms of the series or to any relation between these terms. The letter in Lacan's commentary on Edgar Allan Poe's story, for example, is one such case.</mark> [Page 54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=54&annotation=LGA5JLBD) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What are the characteristics of this paradoxical entity? It circulates without end in both series and, for this reason, assures their communication. It is a two-sided entity, equally present in the signifying and the signified series. It is the mirror. Thus, it is at once word and thing, name and object, sense and denotatum, expression and designation, etc. It guarantees, therefore, the convergence of the two series which it traverses, but precisely on the condition that it makes them endlessly diverge.</mark> [Page 54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=54&annotation=SBSFM8XH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We must say that the paradoxical entity is never where we look for it, and conversely that we never find it where it is. As Lacan says, it fails to observe its place (elle manque a sa place). 6 It also fails to observe its own identity, resemblance, equilibrium, and origin.</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=55&annotation=EKKTHZQJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But they are strictly simultaneous in relation to the entity by means of which they communicate. They are simultaneous without ever being equal, since the entity has two sides, one of which is always absent from the other. It behooves it, therefore, to be in excess in the one series which it constitutes as signifying, and lacking in the other which it constitutes as signified: split apart, incomplete by nature or in relation to itself. Its excess always refers to its own lack, and conversely, its lack always refers to its excess.</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=55&annotation=PT5U5LKE) 
- [N] The paradox of regress leads to a serial form, specifically two simultaneous heterogeneous series.
- [N] These two series (e.g., denotation/expression, consumable/expressible) are never equal; one functions as signifier, the other as signified.
- [N] The relationship between the series is one of perpetual relative displacement and disequilibrium.
- [N] The signifying series often presents an excess over the signified.
- [N] A paradoxical entity traverses and communicates between the two series, being simultaneously present in both (word/thing, sense/denotatum).
- [N] This paradoxical entity is always displaced in relation to itself, lacking identity and failing to observe its place.
- [N] The entity is simultaneously in excess in the signifying series and lacking in the signified series.

> The sixth series explores the necessary consequence of the regress paradox: the emergence of serial form, specifically the coexistence of at least two heterogeneous series (signifier and signified). These series are in constant disequilibrium and displacement, linked by a paradoxical entity (like Lacan's letter) that circulates between them, being simultaneously present in both while failing to occupy a fixed place or identity.

It is thus as a portmanteau word that "Jabber-wock" connotes two series analogous to those of "Snark."

### Eighth Series of Structure

<mark class="hltr-purple">Eighth Series of Structure</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=62&annotation=3LJEFR5V) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Levi-Strauss has indicated a paradox in the form of an antinomy, which is similar to Lacan's paradox: two series being given, one signifying and the other signified, the first presents an excess and the latter a lack. By means of this excess and this lack, the series refer to each other in eternal disequilibrium and in perpetual displacement.</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=62&annotation=AMIHPEIF)

<mark class="hltr-blue">Any society whatsoever has all of its rules at once-juridical, religious, political, economic; laws governing love and labor, kinship and marriage, servitude and freedom, life and death. But the conquest of nature, without which it would no longer be a society, is achieved progressively, from one source of energy to another, from one object to another. This is why law weighs with all its might, even before its object is known, and without ever its object becoming exactly known. It is this disequilibrium that makes revolutions possible. It is not at all the case that revolutions are determined by technical progress. Rather, they are made possible by this gap between the two series, which solicits realignments of the economic and political totality in relation to the parts of the technical progress</mark> [Page 63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=63&annotation=DTGQGKDQ) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The technocrat is the natural friend of the dictator-computers and dictatorship; but the revolutionary lives in the gap which separates technical progress from social totality, and inscribes there his dream of permanent revolution.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What is in excess in the signifying series is literally an empty square and an always displaced place without an occupant.

> This section defines 'structure' based on the relation between at least two heterogeneous series (signifying/signified) characterized by singularities (ideal events). The structure functions through a paradoxical element (like a "floating signifier" or "empty square") that traverses the series, embodying excess and lack, ensuring their disequilibrium, and ultimately distributing singularities and bestowing sense, demonstrating that structure and event are not opposed.

### Ninth Series of the Problematic

<mark class="hltr-purple">Ninth Series of the Problematic</mark> [Page 66](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=66&annotation=YM7YIYKS) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">What is an ideal event? It is a singularity-or rather a set of singularities or of singular points characterizing a mathematical curve, a physical state of affairs, a psychological and moral person. Singularities are turning points and points of inflection; bottlenecks, knots, foyers, and centers; points of fusion, condensation, and boiling; points of tears and joy, sickness and health, hope and anxiety, "sensitive" points.</mark> [Page 66](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=66&annotation=XN2I5AFV) 
- [N] Singularity 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The singularity belongs to another dimension than that of denotation, manifestation, or signification. It is essentially pre-individual, non-personal, and a-conceptual. It is quite indifferent to the individual and the collective, the personal and the impersonal, the particular and the general-and to their oppositions. Singularity is neutral. On the other hand, it is not "ordinary": the singular point is opposed to the ord. I mary.</mark> [Page 66](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=66&annotation=GVYQW6W5) 
- [N] Singularity is pre-individual, non-personal, a-conceptual, and neutral, distinct from denotation, manifestation, signification.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">not only are there several divergent series in a structure, but each series is itself constituted by several convergent sub-series.</mark> [Page 67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=67&annotation=99JSYGVM) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Peguy clearly saw that history and event were inseparable from those singular points: "Events have critical points just as temperature has critical points-points of fusion, congelation, boiling, condensation, coagulation, and crystallization. And even within the event there are states of surfeit which are precipitated, crystallized, and determined only by the introduction of a fragment of the future event."</mark> [Page 67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=67&annotation=8IXSDM7G) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Events are ideal.</mark> [Page 67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=67&annotation=GE9UZHH7) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Novalis sometimes says that there are two courses of events, one of them ideal, the other real and imperfect-for ex-ample, ideal Protestanism and real Lutheranism. 3 The distinction howt'ver is not between two sorts of events; rather, it is between the event, which is ideal by nature, and its spatio-temporal realization in a state of affairs. The distinction is between event and accident.</mark> [Page 67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=67&annotation=2XUGHVJV) 
- [N] Event and accident 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Events are idea-tional singularities which communicate in one and the same Event. They have therefore an eternal truth, and their time is never the present which realizes them and makes them exist. Rather, it is the unlimited Aion, the Infinitive in which they subsist and insist. Events are the only idcalitics.</mark> [Page 67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=67&annotation=XDDNXTQP) 

<mark class="hltr-green">To reverse Platonism is first and foremost to remove essences and to substitute events in their place, as jets of singularities.</mark> [Page 67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=67&annotation=X8PZ8ANJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The mode of the event is the problematic. One must not say that there are problematic events, but that events bear exclusively upon problems and define their conditions.</mark> [Page 68](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=68&annotation=2K9AY9VN) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The event by itself is problematic and problematizing. A problem is determined only by the singular points which express its conditions. We do not say that the problem is thereby resolved; on the contrary, it is determined as a problem.</mark> [Page 68](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=68&annotation=B447IV2U) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We must then break with the long habit of thought which forces us to consider the problematic as a subjective category of our knowledge or as an empirical moment which would indicate only the imperfection of our method and the unhappy necessity for us not to know ahead of time-a necessity which would disappear as we acquire knowledge. Even if the problem is concealed by its solution, it subsists nonetheless in the Idea which relates it to its conditions and organizes the genesis of the solutions. Without this Idea, the solutions would have no sense. The problematic is both an objective category of knowledge and a perfectly objective kind of being. "Problematic" qualifies precisely the ideal objectivities.</mark> [Page 68](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=68&annotation=L5YADNBJ) 
- [N] The problematic is objective 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The relation between mathematics and man may thus be conceived in a new way: the question is not that of quantifying or measuring human properties, but rather, on the one hand, that of problematizing human events, and, on the other, that of developing as various human events the conditions of a problem.</mark> [Page 69](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=69&annotation=GZQ6AHFK)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We can speak of events only in the context of the problem whose conditions they determine.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The problem is determined by singular points corresponding to the series, but the question is determined by an aleatory point corresponding to the empty square or mobile element. The metamorphoses or redistributions of singularities form a history; each combination and each distribution is an event. But the paradoxical instance is the Event in which all events communicate and are distributed. It is the Unique event, and all other events are its bits and pieces.</mark> [Page 70](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=70&annotation=FS8BKR3V) 
- [N] The locus of a question 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The ques-tion is developed in problems, and the problems are enveloped in a fundamental question. And just as solutions do not suppress problems, but on the contrary discover in them the subsisting conditions without which they would have no sense, answers do not at all suppress, nor do they saturate, the question, which persists in all of the answers. There is therefore an aspect in which problems remain without a solution, and the question without an answer. It is in this sense that problem and question designate ideational objectivities and have their own being, a minimum ?f bein9 (see the "answerless riddles" of Alice).</mark> [Page 70](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=70&annotation=MV5Z86CA) 
- [N] Events are ideal singularities that exist in the unlimited time of the Aion (eternal truth), distinct from their real actualization as accidents in the present.
- [N] Events function as problematic, defining the conditions of problems.
- [N] Problems are not merely subjective or temporary states of ignorance; they are objective categories of knowledge and kinds of being, determined by singular points.
- [N] Problems subsist even when solutions are found; solutions reveal the conditions within the problem.

> The ninth series defines events as ideal, pre-individual, non-personal singularities that constitute the problematic. Problems are objective realities, determined by these singularities, which subsist even when solutions are found. The problematic is itself an objective kind of being, and singularities are ideal objectivities deployed in a problematic field, culminating in a unique Event where all singularities communicate.

### Tenth Series of the Ideal Game

<mark class="hltr-purple">Tenth Series of the Ideal Game</mark> [Page 72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=72&annotation=VWIXUEPT) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Whether it be Pascal's gambling man or Leibniz's chess-playing God, the game is explicitly taken as a model only because it has implicit models which are not games: the moral model of the Good or the Best, the economic model of causes and effects, or of means and ends.</mark> [Page 73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=73&annotation=FGKNIGUT)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) Far from dividing and apportioning chance in a really distinct number of throws, all throws affirm chance and endlessly ramify it with each throw.</mark> [Page 73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=73&annotation=E2BHKPYH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) The throws therefore are not really or numerically distinct. They are qualitatively distinct, but are the qualitative forms of a single cast which is ontologically one.</mark> [Page 73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=73&annotation=5H86473A) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is a nomadic and non-sedentary distribution, wherein each system of singularities communicates and resonates with the oth-ers, being at once implicated by the others and implicating them in the most important cast. It is the game of problems and of the question, no longer the game of the categorical and the hypothetical.</mark> [Page 74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=74&annotation=HASI75EI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">4-) Such a game-without rules, with neither winner nor loser, without responsibility, a game of innocence, a caucus-race, in which skill and chance are no longer distinguishable-seems to have no reality.</mark> [Page 74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=74&annotation=7SJQNIW9) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The ideal game of which we speak cannot be played by either man or God. It can only be thought as nonsense. But precisely for this reason, it is the reality of thought itself and the unconscious of pure thought. Each thought forms a series in a time which is smaller than the minimum of consciously thinkable continuous time. Each thought emits a distribution of singularities. All of these thoughts communicate in one long thought, causing all the forms or figures of the nomadic distribution to correspond to its own displacement, everywhere insin-uating chance and ramifying each thought, linking the "once and for all" to "each time" for the sake of "all time." For only thought finds it possible to <ifjirm all chance and to make chance into an object ef <ifjirmation. If one tries to play this game other than in thought, nothing happens; and if one tries to produce a result other than the work of art, nothing is produced. This game is reserved then for thought and art. In it there is nothing but victories for those who know how to play, that is, how to affirm and ramify chance, instead of dividing it in order to dominate it, in order to wager, in order to win. This game, which can only exist in thought and which has no other result than the work of art, is also that by which thought and art are real and disturbing reality, morality, and the economy of the world.</mark> [Page 74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=74&annotation=SUTFQ5CN) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">This is how J. L. Borges describes the Babylonian lottery: if the lottery is an intensification of chance, a periodic infusion of chaos into the cosmos, would it not be desirable for chance to intervene at all stages of the lottery and not merely in the drawing? Is it not ridiculous for chance to dictate the death of someone while the circumstances of his death-its silent reserve or publicity, the time limit of one hour or one century-should remain immune to hazard? ...

<mark class="hltr-blue">One of the esoteric words found in "Jabber-wocky" contaminates both times: "wabe." For, according to one sense, "wabe" must be understood as having been derived from "swab" or "soak." In this case, it would designate the rain-drenched lawn sur-rounding a sundial; it is the physical and cyclical Chronos of the variable living present. But in another sense, it is the lane extending far ahead and far behind, "way-be," "a long way before, a long way behind." It is the incorporeal Aion which has been unfolded. It has become autono-mous in the act of disinvesting itself from its matter and flees in both directions at once, toward the future and toward the past. In it, even rain falls horizontally following the hypothesis of Sylvie and Bruno.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The agonizing aspect of the pure event is that it is always and at the same time something which has just happened and something about to happen; never something which is happening. The x, with respect to which one feels that it just happened, is the object of the "novella"; and the x which is always about to happen, is the object of the "tale" ("conte").

### Eleventh Series of Nonsense

<mark class="hltr-purple">Eleventh Series of Nonsense</mark> [Page 80](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=80&annotation=XEB367RE) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Let us summarize the characteristics of this paradoxical element or perpetuum mobile. Its function is to traverse the heterogeneous series, to coordinate them, to make them resonate and converge, but also to ramify them and to introduce into each one of them multiple disjunc-tions. It is both word = x and thing= x. Since it belongs simultaneously to both series, it has two sides. But the sides are never balanced, joined together, or paired off, because the paradoxical element is always in disequilibrium in relation to itself. To account for this correlation and this dissymmetry we made use of a number of dualities: it is at once excess and lack, empty square and supernumerary object, a place without an occupant and an occupant without a place, "floating signi-fier" and floated signified, esoteric word and exoteric thing, white word and black object. This is why it is constantly denoted in two ways: "for the Snark was a Boojum, you see."</mark> [Page 80](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=80&annotation=WKX7BX8P) 
- [N] Summary of the paradoxical element 

<mark class="hltr-blue">"Snark" is an unheard-of name, but it is also an invisible monster. It refers to a formidable action, the hunt, at the end of which the hunter is dissipated and loses his identity. "Jabberwock" is an unheard-of name, a fantastic beast, but also the object of a formidable action or of a great murder.</mark> [Page 81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=81&annotation=M3YL4PUA) 
- [N] Addition of action = x 

<mark class="hltr-orange">First fi9ure: the para-doxical element is at once word and thing. In other words, both the blank word denoting it and the esoteric word denoting the blank word have the function to express the thing. It is a word that denotes exactly what it expresses and expresses what it denotes. It says something, but at the same time it says the sense of what it says: it says its own sense. It is therefore completely abnormal.</mark> [Page 81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=81&annotation=VPL6GCMY) 
- [N] First order esoteric words 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The name saying its own sense can only be nonsense (Nn). Nonsense is of a piece with the word "nonsense," and the word "nonsense" is of a piece with words which have no sense, that is, with the conventional words that we use to denote it.</mark> [Page 81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=81&annotation=S4JC2RP5) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Second fi9ure: the portmanteau word is itself the principle of an alternative the two terms of which it forms (frumious = fuming-andfurious or furious-and-fuming). Each virtual part of such a word denotes the sense of the other or expresses the other part which in turn denotes it. Under the same form, the entire word says its own sense and is, for this reason, nonsense.</mark> [Page 81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=81&annotation=2GS8GAUJ) 
- [N] Second order portmanteau 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nonsense thus has two sides, one corresponding to the regressive synthesis, the other to the disjunctive synthesis.</mark> [Page 81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=81&annotation=QWBUD5BX) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When we assume that nonsense says its own sense, we wish to indicate, on the contrary, that sense and nonsense have a specific relation which can not copy that of the true and false, that is, which can not be conceived simply on the basis of a rdation of exclusion.</mark> [Page 82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=82&annotation=HQK9MVBM) 

<mark class="hltr-green">This is indeed the most general problem of the logic of sense: what would be the purpose of rising from the domain of truth to the domain of sense, if it were only to find between sense and nonsense a relation analogous to that of the true and the false?</mark> [Page 82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=82&annotation=BQUJRMIX) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The logic of sense is necessarily determined to posit between sense and nonsense an original type of intrinsic relation, a mode of co-presence.</mark> [Page 82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=82&annotation=JLTQ4KHW) 

<mark class="hltr-magenta">Every property must belong to a type higher than the properties or individuals over which it presides, and every class must belong to a type higher than the objects which it contains. It follows that a class cannot be a member of itself, nor may it contain members of difkrent types.</mark> [Page 82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=82&annotation=S2ACY2CJ) 
- [N] This refers to Russell's theory of types, which aimed to avoid logical paradoxes (like the set of all sets that are not members of themselves) by creating a hierarchy. Properties and classes must be of a "higher type" than the things they apply to or contain. A class cannot contain itself or things of a different type. This is brought up here because the paradoxical element and nonsense seem to violate such a hierarchy.

<mark class="hltr-magenta">two forms of the absurd correspond to the two figures of nonsense, and these forms are defined as "stripped of signification" and as constituting paradoxes: a set which is included in itself as a member; the member dividing the set which it presupposes -the set of all sets, and the "barber of the regiment."</mark> [Page 83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=83&annotation=83VL64K6) 
- [N] These are examples of paradoxes that arise from violating the theory of types, like the barber who shaves all those, and only those, who do not shave themselves (does the barber shave himself?). These are presented as analogous to the "absurd" or nonsense, being stripped of logical signification but still having a kind of sense or position (as discussed in the paradox of the absurd).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">a term devoid of signification has nonetheless a sense, and the sense or the event is independent of all the modalities affecting classes and properties, being neutral in relation to all of these characteristics.</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=84&annotation=RM643QQC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Inside the series, each term has sense only by virtue of its position relative to every other term. But this relative position itself depends on the absolute position of each term relative to the instance = x. The latter is determined as nonsense and circulates endlessly throughout the series. Sense is actually produced by this circulation as sense which affects both the signifier and the signified. In short, sense is always an effect. It is not an effect merely in the causal sense; it is also an effect in the sense of an "optical effect" or a "sound effect," or, even better, a surface effect, a position effect, and a language effect.</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=84&annotation=GRIIJKMB) 
- [N] Sense is produced, it is an effect 

<mark class="hltr-orange">nonsense does not have any particular sense, but is opposed to the absence of sense rather than to the sense that it produces in excess-without ever maintaining with its product the simple relation of exclusion to which some people would like to reduce them. 3 Nonsense is that which has no sense, and that which, as such and as it enacts the donation of sense, is opposed to the absence of sense. This is what we must understand by "nonsense."</mark> [Page 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=85&annotation=VNIEMDMD) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is thus pleasing that there resounds today the news that sense is never a principle or an origin, but that it is produced. It is not something to discover, to restore, and to re-employ; it is something to produce by a new machinery. It belongs to no height or depth, but rather to a surface effect, being inseparable from the surface which is its proper dimension. It is not that sense lacks depth or height, but rather that height and depth lack surface, that they lack sense, or have it only by virtue of an "effect" which presupposes sense.</mark> [Page 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=86&annotation=IQABDFWS) 

<mark class="hltr-green">And how could we not feel that our freedom and strength reside, not in the divine universal nor in the human personality, but in these singularities which are more us than we ourselves are, more divine than the gods, as they animate concretely poem and aphorism, permanent revolution and partial action?

<mark class="hltr-green">neither man nor God; singularities which are neither general nor individual, neither personal nor universal. All of this is traversed by circulations, echoes, and events which produce more sense, more freedom, and more strength than man has ever dreamed of, or God ever conceived. Today's task is to make the empty square circulate and to make pre-individual and nonpersonal singularities speak-in short, to pro-duce sense.</mark> [Page 87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=87&annotation=52VDUCGR) 
- [N] Nonsense is the paradoxical element that traverses and organizes heterogeneous series, acting as word=x and thing=x, always in disequilibrium.
- [N] Nonsense has two figures: the esoteric word saying its own sense (regressive synthesis) and the portmanteau word forming an alternative of its terms (disjunctive synthesis).
- [N] Nonsense does not exclude sense like falsehood excludes truth; they have an intrinsic relation, a co-presence.
- [N] Sense is not a principle but is produced as an effect (surface effect, position effect, language effect) by the circulation of nonsense within the series.
- [N] Nonsense is not the absence of sense, but that which has no sense itself yet is opposed to the absence of sense and enacts the donation/production of sense.
- [N] Sense is a surface phenomenon, belonging to no height or depth.
- [N] The task is to produce sense by allowing the empty square (nonsense) and pre-individual singularities to circulate and speak.

> The eleventh series defines nonsense not as the absence of sense but as the positive, paradoxical element (word=x, thing=x, empty square) that traverses and organizes series, embodying regressive and disjunctive syntheses. Sense is produced by the circulation of nonsense as a surface effect. Unlike truth and falsehood, sense and nonsense have an intrinsic relation of co-presence; nonsense is what has no sense but enables the donation of sense, operating at the surface, liberated from traditional notions of depth or height.

### Twelfth Series of the Paradox

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twelfth Series of the Paradox</mark> [Page 88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=88&annotation=WEI6CYRZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The force of paradoxes is that they are not contradictory; they rather allow us to be prescnt at the genesis of the contradiction.</mark> [Page 88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=88&annotation=YID83UC6) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The paradoxes of signification are essentially that of the abnormal set (which is included as a member or which includes members of different types) and that of the rebel element (which forms part of a set whose existence it presupposes and belongs to two sub-sets which it determines).</mark> [Page 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=89&annotation=BEY2NQHK) 
- [N] Paradoxes of signification 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The paradoxes of sense are essentially that of the subdivision ad infinitum (always past-future and never present), and that of the nomadic distribution ( distributing in an open space instead of distributing a closed space). They always have the characteristic of going in both directions at once, and of rendering identification impossible, as they emphasize sometimes the first, sometimes the second, of these effects.</mark> [Page 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=89&annotation=LNV5FXFW) 
- [N] Paradoxes of sense 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Paradox is opposed to doxa, in both aspects of doxa, namely, good sense and common sense.</mark> [Page 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=89&annotation=PSJD4JM7) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good sense is essentially distributive; "on one hand and on the other hand" is its formula.</mark> [Page 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=89&annotation=8DBCMK2M) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good sense is altogether combustive and digestive. It is agricultural, inseparable from the agrarian problem, the establishment of enclosures, and the dealings of middle classes the parts of which are supposed to balance and to regulate one another. The steam engine and the livestock, but also properties and classes, are the living sources of good sense, not only as facts which spring up in a particular period, but as eternal archetypes.</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=90&annotation=6Q88MYFH) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The systematic characteristics of good sense are thus the following: it affirms a single direction; it determines this direction to go from the most to the least differentiated, from the singular to the regular, and from the remarkable to the ordinary; it orients the arrow of time from past to future, according to this determination; it assigns to the present a directing role in this orientation; it renders possible thereby the function of prevision; and it selects the sedentary type of distribution in which all of the preceding characteristics are brought together.</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=90&annotation=BR8TUDKD) 
- [N] Good sense is directional, moves from singular to ordinary, orients time from past to future via the present, allows prevision, uses sedentary distribution.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good sense plays a capital role in the determination of signification, but plays no role in the donation of sense.</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=90&annotation=KQAEKD3A) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good sense is not content with determining the particular direction of the unique sense. It first determines the principle of a unique sense or direction in g(Â·m-ral, ready to show that this principle, once given, forces us to</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=90&annotation=V35DESI2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">choose one direction over the other. The power of the paradox there-fore is not all in following the other direction, but rather in showing that sense always takes on both senses at once, or follows two directions at the same time.</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=91&annotation=EN6TWKZ6) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">"Which way, which way?" asks Alice. The question has no answer, since it is the characteristic of sense not to have any direction or "good sense." Rather, sense always goes to both directions at once, in the infinitely subdivided and elongated past-future.</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=91&annotation=WXUUX5YI) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">"For the entire universe, the two directions of time are thus impossible to distinguish, and the same holds for space; there is neither above nor below" (that is, there is neither height nor depth).</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=91&annotation=WHUGDTD2) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Chronos is the present which alone exists. It makes of the past and future its two oriented dimensions, so that one goes always from the past to the future-but only to the degree that presents follow one another inside partial worlds or partial systems.</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=91&annotation=I5XF5VSE)

- [N] Common sense is a faculty of identification and recognition, bringing diversity to the form of the Same.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Objectively, common sense subsumes under itself the given diversity and relates it to the unity of a particular form of object or an individualized form of a world. It is the same object which I see, smell, taste, or touch; it is the same object which I perceive, imagine, and remember ... ; and, it is the same world that I breathe, walk, am awake or asleep in, as I move from one object to another following the laws of a determined system.</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=92&annotation=3HWJ9LPX)

<mark class="hltr-green">The paradox therefore is the simultaneous reversal of good sense and com-mon sense: on one hand, it appears in the guise of the two simultaneous senses or directions of the becoming-mad and the unforeseeable; on the other hand, it appears as the nonsense of the lost identity and the unrecognizable.</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=92&annotation=ED5CYGRW) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Beyond good sense, Carroll's doubles represent the two senses or two directions of the becoming-mad. Let us look first at the doublet of the Hatter and the March Hare in Alice: each one of them lives in one direction, but the two directions are inseparable; each direction subdivides itself into the other, to the point that both are found in either. Two are necessary for being mad; one is always mad in tandem. The Hatter and the Hare went mad together the day they "murdered time," that is, the day they destroyed the measure, suppressed the pauses and the rests which relate quality to something fixed. The Hatter and the Hare killed the present which no longer survives between them except in the sleepy image of the Dormouse, their tortured companion. But also this present no longer subsists except in the abstract moment, at tea time, being indefinitely subdivisible into past and future. The result is that they now change places endlessly, they are always late and early, in both directions at once, but never on time. On the other side of the lookingglass, the Hare and the Hatter are taken up again in the two messengers, one going and the other coming, one searching and the other bringing back, on the basis of the two simultaneous directions of the Aion.</mark> [Page 93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=93&annotation=EXF622EL) 
- [N] The paradoxical hatter and the hare 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is nothing astonishing in the fact that the paradox is the force of the unconscious: it occurs always in the space between (l'entre-deux) con-sciousnesses, contrary to good sense or, behind the back of consciousness, contrary to common sense.</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=94&annotation=VECL4G7K) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">For if it is a question of knowing "why at this moment rather than at another," "why water changes its state of quality at o O centigrade," the question is poorly stated insofar as o O is considered as an ordinary point on the thermom-eter. But if it is considered, on the contrary, as a singular point, it is inseparable from the event occurring at that point, always being zero in relation to its realization on the line of ordinary points, always forth-coming and already passed.</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=94&annotation=XDGYU4LR) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But, precisely because nonsense has an internal and original relation to sense, this paradoxical element bestows sense upon the terms of each series. The relative positions of these terms in relation to one another depend on their "absolute" position in relation to it. Sense is always an effect produced in the series by the instance which traverses them. This is why sense, such as it is gathered over the line of the Aion, has two sides which correspond to the dissymmetrical sides of the paradoxical element: one tending toward the series determined as signifying, the other tending toward the series determined as signified.</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=95&annotation=ATWKRFUK) 
- [N] Paradox allows us to witness the genesis of contradiction, rather than being contradictory itself.
- [N] Paradox is opposed to *doxa*, encompassing both good sense (direction, prevision, sedentary distribution) and common sense (identification, recognition, form of the Same).
- [N] Good sense relates to signification but not the donation of sense.
- [N] Paradox reverses *doxa* by affirming two simultaneous directions/senses (becoming-mad) and the nonsense of lost identity/unrecognizable (unlike common sense which identifies).
- [N] Paradox is the force of the unconscious, operating between consciousnesses and challenging *doxa*.
- [N] Paradoxical element (nonsense) bestows sense on the series it traverses, creating sense as a produced effect with two sides (signifying/signified).

> The twelfth series positions paradox as a force that undermines *doxa* (common sense and good sense). While good sense relies on a single direction and common sense on fixed identities, paradox affirms simultaneous directions (becoming-mad, unforeseeable) and dissolves fixed identities (nonsense of the unrecognizable), reflecting the fluid, double-sided nature of sense itself, which is produced by the paradoxical element traversing series.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Artaud considers Lewis Carroll a pervert, a little pervert, who holds onto the establishment of a surface language, and who has not felt the real problem of a language in depth -namely, the schizophrenic problem of suffering, of death, and of life. To Artaud, Carroll's games seem puerile, his food too worldly, and even his fecality hypocritical and too well-bred.</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=98&annotation=2AJ77R89) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">At a deeper level, he ensures a resonance between the two series and a conversion from one to the other, as he translates English words into foreign words according to their phonetic elements (consonants being the most important). "Tree," for example, is converted as a result of the R which recurs in the French word "arbre," and again as a result of the T which recurs in the Hebrew term; and since the Russians say "derevo" for tree, one can equally well transform "tree" into "tere," with T becoming D. This already complex procedure is replaced by a more generalized one, as soon as the patient has the idea of evoking a number of associations: "early," whose consonants R and L pose particularly delicate problems, is transformed into various associated French locutions: "surR-Le-champ," "de bonne heuRe," "matinaLement," "a la pa Role, " "devoRer L 'espace," or even into an esoteric and fictional word of German consonance, "urlich." (One recalls that Raymond Roussel, in the techniques he invented in order to constitute and to convert series within the French language, distinguishes a pri-mary, restricted procedure and a secondary, generalized procedure based on associations.) It is often the case that some rebellious words resist all of these procedures, giving rise to insufferable paradoxes. Thus, "ladies," for example, which applies to only half of the human popula-tion, can be transcribed only by the German "leutte" or the Russian "loudi," which, on the contrary, designate the totality of humankind.</mark> [Page 99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=99&annotation=RBJI7SR8)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The two series are articulated at the surface. On this surface, a line is like the frontier between two series, propositions and things, or between dimensions of the same proposi-tion. Along this line, sense is elaborated, both as what is expressed by the proposition and as the attribute of things-the "expressible" of expressions and the "attributable" of denotations. The two series are therefore articulated by their difference, and sense traverses the entire surface, although it remains on its own line. Undoubtedly, this immaterial sense is the result of corporeal things, of their mixtures, and of their actions and passions. But the result has a very different nature than the corporeal cause. It is for this reason that sense, as an effect, being always at the surface, refers to a quasi-cause which is itself incorporeal. This is the always mobile nonsense, which is expressed in esoteric and in portmanteau words, and which distributes sense on both sides simultaneously. All of this forms the surface organization upon which Carroll's work plays a mirror-like effect.</mark> [Page 100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=100&annotation=SLLK29H8)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the contradic-tion lived in schizophrenia finds its real point of application: passion and action are the inseparable poles of an ambivalence, because the two languages which they form belong inseparably to the body and to the depth of bodies.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What defines this second language and this method of action, prac-tically, is its consonantal, guttural, and aspirated overloads, its apostrophes and internal accents, its breaths and its scansions, and its modulation which replaces all syllabic or even literal values.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The duality of the schizophrenic word has not been adequately noted: it comprises the passion-word, which explodes into wounding phonetic values, and the action-word, which welds inarticulate tonic values. These two words are developed in relation to the duality of the body, fragmented body and body without organs. They refer to two theaters, the theater of terror or passion and the theater of cruelty, which is by its essence active. They refer to two types of nonsense, passive and active: the nonsense of the word devoid of sense, which is decomposed into phonetic elements; and the nonsense of tonic elements, which form a word incapable of being decomposed and no less devoid of sense. Here everything happens, acts and is acted upon, beneath sense and far from the surface. Sub-sense, a-sense, Untersinn-this must be distinguished from the nonsense of the surface. According to Holderlin, language in its two aspects is "a sign empty of meaning." Although a sign, it is a sign which merges with an action or a passion of the body.</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=104&annotation=Y67HYEUS)

Carroll, on the contrary, awaits the child, in a manner conforming to his language of incorporeal sense: he waits at the point and at the moment in which the child has left the depths of the maternal body and has yet to discover the depth of her own body. This is the brief surface moment in which the little girl skirts the surface of the water, like Alice in the pool of her own tears. These are different regions, different and unrelated dimensions. We may believe that the surface has its monsters, the Snark and the Jabberwock, its terrors and its cruelties, which, although not of the depths, have claws just the same and can snap one up laterally, or even make us fall back into the abyss which we believed we had dispelled.</mark> [Page 107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=107&annotation=QKH7MEJ4)

> This section contrasts Carroll's focus on the surface organization of sense with Artaud's exploration of the depths of the body and language in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is presented as a state where the surface collapses, language is reabsorbed into bodily actions and passions (noise, sub-sense), and duality exists only between actions and passions of the body, distinct from the surface duality articulated by sense.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For, insofar as it affirms its difference in nature from corporeal causes, states of affairs, qualities, and physical mixtures, sense as an effect or event is character-ized by a striking impassibility (impenetrability, sterility, or inefficacy, which is neither active nor passive).</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=109&annotation=GSLTXM6N) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Viewed from this angle, it appears as a neutrality (a mere double extracted from the proposition, or a suspension of the modalities of the proposition).

This dual relation ensures the autonomy and generative power of sense, making it impassive and neutral in itself while enabling the genesis of propositions and even states of affairs.

Still, the soldier needs a long struggle in order to arrive at this beyond of courage and cowardice, to this pure grasping of the event by means of a "volitional intuition," that is, by means of the will that the event creates in him.

From the point of view of modality, it is neither assertoric nor apodeictic, nor even interrogative (the mode of subjective uncertainty or objective possibility). From the point of view of relation, it is not confused within the proposition which expresses it, either with denotation, or with manifestation, or with signification. Hnally, from the point of view of the type, it is not confused with any of the intuitions, or any of the "positions" of consciousness that we could empirically determine thanks to the play of the preceding propositional traits: intuitions or positions of empirical perception, imagination, memory, understanding, volition, etc.</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=115&annotation=QTEI8S8T)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">And this is why (determination number five) this world of sense has a problematic status: singularities are distributed in a properly problematic field and crop up in this field as topological events to which no direction is attached. As with chemical elements, with respect to which we know where they are before we know what they are, likewise here we know of the existence and distribution of singular points before we know their nature (bottlenecks, knots, foyers, centers ... ).</mark> [Page 118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=118&annotation=XXMNHP4X)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche's discovery lies elsewhere when, having liberated himself from Schopenhauer and Wagner, he explored a world of impersonal and pre-individual singularities, a world he then called Dionysian or of the will to power, a free and unbound energy. These are nomadic singularities which are no longer imprisoned within the fixed individu-ality of the infinite Being (the notorious immutability of God), nor inside the sedentary boundaries of the finite subject (the notorious limits of knowledge). This is something neither individual nor personal, but rather singular. Being not an undifferentiated abyss, it leaps from one singularity to another, casting always the dice belonging to the same cast, always fragmented and formed again in each throw. It is a Dionysian sense-producing machine, in which nonsense and sense are no longer found in simple opposition, but are rather co-present to one another within a new discourse. The new discourse is no longer that of the form, but neither is it that of the formless: it is rather that of the pure unformed. To the charge "You shall be a monster, a shapeless mass," Nietzsche responds: "We have realized this prophecy."</mark> [Page 121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=121&annotation=K6FV4UN4) 
- [N] Nietzsche discovered a world of impersonal, pre-individual, nomadic singularities (Will to Power) that are singular rather than individual or personal.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">As for the subject of this new discourse ( except that there is no longer any subject), it is not man or God, and even less man in the place of God. The subject is this free, anonymous, and nomadic singularity which traverses men as well as plants and animals independently of the matter of their individuation and the forms of their personality. "Overman" means nothing other than this-the superior type of everything that is.</mark> [Page 121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=121&annotation=TJMCGCPL) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">He could not stand to stay on the fragile surface, which he had nevertheless plotted through men and gods. Returning to a bottomless abyss that he renewed and dug out afresh, that is where Nietzsche perished in his own manner. It would be preferable to say that he "quasi-perished"; for sickness and death are the event itself, subject as such to a double causality: that of bodies, states of affairs, and mixtures, but also that of the quasi-cause which represents the state of organization or disorganization of the incorporeal surface. Nietzsche, it seems, became insane and died of general paralysis, a corporeal syphilitic mixture. But the pathway which this event followed, this time in relation to the quasi-cause inspiring his entire work and co-inspiring his life, has nothing to do with his general paralysis, the ocular migraines and the vomiting from which he suffered, with the exception of giving them a new causality, that is, an eternal truth independent of their corporeal realization-thus a style in an reuvre instead of a mixture in the body. We see no other way of raising the question of the relations between an reuvre and illness except by means of this double causality.</mark> [Page 122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=122&annotation=SKAL45DC) 
- [N] Nietzsche's work (Å“uvre) and illness are related through the double causality of the event (corporeal mix and incorporeal quasi-cause).
- [N] Sense/events are neutral and impassive, allowing them eternal truth distinct from actualizations.
- [N] Singularities are emissions on an unconscious surface, auto-unifying through nomadic distribution, distinct from consciousness syntheses.
- [N] Singularities organize heterogeneous series into metastable systems with potential energy.
- [N] Singularities auto-unify via a mobile paradoxical element (aleatory point).
- [N] Singularities haunt the surface ("the deepest is the skin"), which has vital potential energy.
- [N] The surface is the locus of sense and symbolic organization.
- [N] The world of sense is problematic; singularities are topological events in a problematic field.
- [N] Transcendental philosophy should define the transcendental field by impersonal, pre-individual singularities, not in the image of consciousness.

> The fifteenth series defines singularities as pre-individual, impersonal, and neutral events that constitute the transcendental field, distinct from individuals, persons, or universal concepts. These singularities organize metastable systems on the surface, auto-unify via a mobile paradoxical element, and are the locus of sense. This perspective, exemplified by Nietzsche's "will to power," involves a new discourse and ontology based on the affirmation of singular difference, moving beyond traditional philosophies centered on the self, world, or God.

The ex-traordinary notion of compossibility is thus defined as a continuum of singularities, whereby continuity has the convergence of series as its ideational criterion.

The second stage, built upon the first by nonsense, produces common worlds, persons, and concepts (Welt), associated with common sense. This genesis reveals individuals and persons not as primary but as products derived from the pre-individual and impersonal transcendental field, showing how good sense and common sense are implicitly undermined by the paradox of their origin.

### Seventeenth Series of the Static Logical Genesis

<mark class="hltr-purple">Seventeenth Series of the Static Logical Genesis</mark> [Page 132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=132&annotation=DUD6ELFF) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Individuals are infinite analytic propositions. But while they are infinite with respect to what they express, they are finite with respect to their clear expression, with respect to their corporeal zone of expression. Persons are finite synthetic propositions: finite with respect to their definition, indefinite with respect to their application. Individuals and persons are, in themselves, ontological propositions-persons being grounded on individuals (and conversely, individuals being grounded by the person). The third element of the ontological genesis, however, namely the multiple classes and variable properties which in turn depend on persons, is not embodied in a third proposition which would again be ontological. Rather, this element sends us over to another order of the proposition, and constitutes the condition or the form of possibility of the logical proposition in general. In relation to this condition and simultaneously with it, individuals and persons no longer play the role of ontological propositions. They act now as material instances which realize the possibility and determine within the logical proposition the relations necessary to the existence of the conditioned (conditionne): the relation of denotation as the relation to the individual (the world, the state of affairs, the aggregate, individuated bodies); the relation of manifestation as the relation to the personal; and the relation</mark> [Page 132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=132&annotation=LLZ9Q6GE) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">of signification defined by the form of possibility.</mark> [Page 133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=133&annotation=GYYRKY5H) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">beyond the tertiary order of the proposition and even the secondary organization of sense, we anticipate a terrible primary order wherein the entire language becomes enfolded.</mark> [Page 134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=134&annotation=3JBQRAVM) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Solutions are engen-dered at precisely the same time that the problem determines itself This is why people quite often believe that the solution does not allow the problem to subsist, and that it assigns to it retrospectively the status of a subjective moment which is necessarily transcended as soon as a solution is found. The opposite though is the case. By means of an appropriate process, the problem is determined in space and time and, as it is determined, it determines the solutions in which it persists. The synthesis of the problem with its conditions engenders propositions, their dimensions, and their correlates.</mark> [Page 135](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=135&annotation=7MQARPGS) 
- [N] Problems and solutions 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sense is thus expressed as the problem to which propositions corre-spond insofar as they indicate particular responses, signify instances of a general solution, and manifest subjective acts of resolution.</mark> [Page 135](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=135&annotation=G4T9ZM56) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Interrogation is the shadow only of the problem projected, or rather reconstructed on the basis of empirical propositions. But the problem in itself is the reality of the genetic element, the complex theme which does not allow itself to be reduced to any propositional thesis. 1 It is one and the same illusion which, from an empirical point of view, formulates the problem from the propositions which function as its "answers," and which, from a philosophical or scientific point of view, defines the problem through the form of the possibility of the "corresponding" propositions. This form of possibility may be logical, or it may be geometrical, algebraic, physical, transcendental, moral, etc. It does not matter. As long as we define the problem by its "resolvability," we confuse sense with signification, and we conceive of the condition only in the image of the conditioned.</mark> [Page 136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=136&annotation=RL4YFSQR) 
- [N] Shadow of interrogation 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">That the problem does not exist outside of the propositions which, in their senses, express it means, properly speaking, that the problem is not: it inheres, subsists, or persists in propositions and blends with this extra-being that we had previously encountered.</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=137&annotation=U24F568L) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sense is neutral, but it is never the double of the propositions which express it, nor of the states of affairs in which it occurs and which are denoted by the propositions. This is why, as long as we remain within the circuit of the proposition, sense can be only indirectly inferred.</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=137&annotation=U49H7H7S) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We cannot think of the condition in the image of the conditioned.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The idea itself of a static genesis dissipates the contradiction. When we say that bodies and their mixtures produce sense, it is not by virtue of an individuation which would presuppose it. Individuation in bodies, the measure in their mixtures, the play of persons and concepts in their variations-this entire order presupposes sense and the pre-individual and impersonal neutral field within which it unfolds. It is therefore in a different way that sense is produced by bodies. The question is now about bodies taken in their undifferentiated depth and in their measure-less pulsation. This depth acts in an original way, by means ef its power to or9anize swfaces and to envelop itself within suifaces.</mark> [Page 138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=138&annotation=IB4GYW2W)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The surface is neither active nor passive, it is the product of the actions and passions of mixed bodies. It is characteristic of the surface that it skims over its own field, impassible and indivisible</mark> [Page 138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=138&annotation=MEJQMWNR) 

<mark class="hltr-green">There is therefore an entire' physics of surfaces as the effect of deep mixtures-a physics which endlessly assembles the variations and the pulsations of the entire' universe, enveloping them inside these mobile limits. And, to the physics of surfaces a metaphysical surfact> necessarily corresponds. Metaphysical surface (transcendental field) is the name that will be given to the frontier established, on one hand, between bodies taken together as a whole and inside the limits which envelop them, and on the otht>r, propositions in general. This frontier implies, as we shall see, certain properties of sound in relation to the surfact>, making possible thereby a distinct distribution of language and bodies, or of the corporeal depth and the sonorous continuum. In all these respects, the surface is the transcendental field itself, and the locus of sense and expression. Sense is that which is formed and deployed at the surface. Even the frontier is not a separation, but rather the element of an articulation, so that sense is presented both as that which happens to bodies and that which insists in propositions. We must therefore maintain that sense is a doubling up, and that the neutrality ef sense is inseparable from its status as a double. The fact is that the doubling up does not at all signify an evanescent and disembodied resemblance, an image without flesh-like a smile without a cat. It is rather defined by the production of surfaces, their multiplication and consolidation. This doubling up is the continu-ity of reverse and right sides, the art of establishing this continuity in a way which permits sense, at the surface, to be distributed to both sides at once, as the expressed which subsists in propositions and as the event which occurs in states of bodies. When this production collapses, or when the surface is rent by explosions and by snags, bodies fall back again into their depth; everything falls back again into the anonymous pulsation wherein words are no longer anything but affections of the body-everything falls back into the primary order which grumbles bent"'ath the secondary organization of sense. On the other hand, so long as the surface holds, not only will sense be unfolded upon it as an effect, but it will also partake of the quasi-cause attached to it. It, in</mark> [Page 139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=139&annotation=VTLGXQWF) 

<mark class="hltr-green">turn, brings about individuation and all that ensues in a process of determination of bodies and their measured mixtures; it also produces signification and all that ensues in a process of determination of propo-sitions and their assigned relations. It produces, in other words, the entire tertiary arrangement or the object of the static genesis.</mark> [Page 140](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=140&annotation=75VKIWWY)

- [N] The metaphysical surface is the frontier between bodies (depth) and propositions.
- [N] Sense is a doubling up at the surface, distributing to both sides (expressed in propositions, event in bodies).

> The seventeenth series describes the "static logical genesis," explaining how the problematic nature of sense engenders the dimensions of the proposition (denotation, manifestation, signification). Problems are presented as objective realities that persist even through solutions, revealing their underlying conditions. This process occurs at the surface, which is established as the transcendental field and the locus of sense, produced by deep bodily mixtures but distinct from them, enabling the determination of individuals, persons, and concepts (the tertiary arrangement).

<mark class="hltr-blue">of provocations. On one hand, the philosopher eats with great gluttony, he stuffs himself; he masturbates in public, regretting that hunger cannot be so easily relieved; he does not condemn incest with the mother, the sister, or the daughter; he tolerates cannibalism and anthropophagy-but, in fact, he is also supremely sober and chaste. On the other hand, he keeps quiet when people ask him questions or gives them a blow with his staff. If you pose abstract and difficult questions, he will respond by designating some bit of food, or will give you a whole box of food which he will then break over you-always with a blow of his staff. Yet he also holds a new discourse, a new logos animated with paradox and philosophical values and significations which are new.

### Nineteenth Series of Humor

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The event is the identity of form and void. It is not the object as denoted, but the object as expressed or expressible, never present, but always already in the past and yet to come. As in Mallarme's works, it has the value of its own absence or abolition, since this abolition (abdicatio) is precisely its positwn in the void as the pure Event (dedicatio). "If you have a cane," says the Zen master, "I am giving you one; if you do not have one, I am taking it away." (Or, as Chrysippus said, "If you newr lost something, you have it still; but you never lost horns, er9o you haw horns.")</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=150&annotation=BZ9HX6EQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Across the abolished significa-tions and the lost denotations, the void is the site of sense or of the event which harmonizes with its own nonsense, in the palce where the place only takes place (la ou n 'a plus lieu que le lieu). The void is itself the paradoxical element, the surface nonsense, or the always displaced aleatory point whence the event bursts forth as sense.</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=151&annotation=7YMRYDNQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The question is less that of attaining the immediate than of determining the site where the immediate is "immediately" as not-to-be-attained (comme non-a-atteindre): the surface where the void and every event along with it are made; the frontier as the cutting edge of a sword or the stretched string of the bow. To paint without painting, non-thought, shooting which becomes non-shooting, to speak without speaking: this is not at all the ineffable up above or down below, but rather the frontier and the surface where language becomes possible and, by becoming possible, inspires only a silent and immediate communication, since it could only be spoken in the resus-citation of all the mediate and abolished significations or denotations.</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=151&annotation=W7Z4XNJI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is therefore a matter of disentangling, from a combined threefold operation, a universal form of the individual (real-ity), and, at the same time, of extracting a pure Idea of what we speak about (necessity), and of confronting language with an ideal model assumed to be primitive, natural, or purely rational (possibility).</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=151&annotation=WUJU4I8S) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What all the figures of irony have in common is that they confine the signularity within the limits of the individual or the person. Thus, irony only in appearance assumes the role of a vagabond.</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=153&annotation=567SHQTI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Classical discourse was held by the individual, Romantic discourse by the person. But beneath these two discourses, overturning them in various ways, the faceless Ground speaks now while rumbling.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UIPAHPLU?page=154&annotation=UIPAHPLU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In each case and for each type of discourse, three languages must be distin-guished. First, a real language corresponding to the quite ordinary assignation of the speaker ( the individual, or rather the person ... ). Second, an ideal language representing the model of discourse relative to the form of the one who holds it (the divine model of Cra~vlus in relation to the Socratic subjectivity, for example; or the rational Leibnizian model in relation to classical individuality; or the evolutionist model in relation to the Romantic person). And finally, esoteric lan-guage, which in each case represents the subversion, from the ground up, of the ideal language and the dissolution of the one who holds the real language.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=154&annotation=GEPNLTS4) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Nonsense and sense have done away with their relation of dynamic opposition in order to enter into the co-presence of a static genesis-as the nonsense of the surface and the sense which hovers over it. The tragic and the ironic give way to a new value, that of humor. For if irony is the cocxtmsiveness of being with the individual, or of the I with representation, humor is the co-extensiveness of sense with nonsense. Humor is the art of the surfaces and of the doubles, of nomad singularities and of the always displaced aleatory point; it is the art of the static genesis, the savoir-faire of the pure event, and the "fourth person singular"-with every signification, denotation, and manifestation suspended, all height and depth abolished.</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=155&annotation=RPU27QFN)

- [N] The event is the identity of form and void, the expressed object (noema), not the denoted, existing in the Aion (past/future), not the present.
- [N] The void, where significations/denotations are abolished, is the site of sense and nonsense's co-presence; it's the paradoxical element/surface nonsense.
- [N] Sense is found not in depth or height (ineffable), but at the surface/frontier where language becomes possible.
- [N] Irony confines singularity within the individual or person.
- [N] Humor is a new value (replacing tragic/ironic), co-extensive with the co-presence of sense and nonsense (static genesis).
- [N] Humor is the art of surfaces, doubles, nomad singularities, the pure event, and the "fourth person singular."

> The nineteenth series introduces humor as a philosophical attitude or value distinct from tragedy and irony. Humor is the art of the surface, where sense and nonsense are co-present (static genesis), and where the paradoxical element (void, surface nonsense) enables the pure event to burst forth. Unlike irony, which confines singularity to the individual, humor operates with nomadic singularities and the "fourth person singular," suspending signification, denotation, and manifestation by abolishing height and depth.

- [N] Divination is the art of surfaces and singular points.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Representation attains this topical ideal only by means of the hidden expression which it encompasses, that is, by means of the event it envelops. There is thus a "use" of representation, without which representation would remain lifeless and senseless.</mark> [Page 160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=160&annotation=P86969A3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Representation envelops the event in another nature, it envelops it at its borders, it stretches until this point, and it brings about this lining or hem. This is the operation which defines living usage, to the extent that representation, when it does not reach this point, remains only a dead letter confronting that which it represents, and stupid in its representiveness.</mark> [Page 160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=160&annotation=CXKEUMFV) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The relation to the archer is closer to Zen: the bowman must reach the point where the aim is also not the aim, that is to say, the bowman himself; where the arrow flies over its straight line while creating its own target; where the surface of the target is also the line and the point, the bowman, the shooting of the arrow, and what is shot at. This is the oriental Stoic will as proairesis. The sage waits for the event, that is to say, understands the pure event in its eternal truth, independently of its spatio-temporal actualization, as something eternally yet-to-come and always already passed according to the line of the Aion. But, at the same time, the sage also wills the embodiment and the actualization of the pure incorporeal event in a state of affairs and in his or her own body and flesh. Identifying wi</mark> [Page 160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=160&annotation=9TKKCDB6)

<mark class="hltr-blue">the quasi-cause, the sage wishes to "give a body" to the incorporeal effect, since the effect inherits the cause (Goldschmidt puts it very well, with respect to an event such as going for a walk: "The walk, incorporeal insofar as it is a way of being, acquires a body (prend corps) under the effect of the hegemonic principle which is manifested in it. " 4 And this applies to the wound and to archery just as much as it applies to the stroll).</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=161&annotation=G775L2Z2) 
- [N] Goldschmidt quote: event "acquires a body."

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The quasi-cause does not create, it "operates," and wills only what comes to pass. Representation and its usage therefore intervene at this point. Corporeal causes act and suffer through a cosmic mixture and a universal present which produces the incorporeal event. But the quasi-cause operates by doubling this physical causality-it embodies the event in the most limited possible present which is the most precise and the most instantaneous, the pure instant grasped at the point at which it divides itself into future and past, and no longer the present of the world which would gather into itself the past and the future. The actor occupies the instant, while the character portrayed hopes or fears in the future and remembers or repents in the past: it is in this sense that the actor "represents." To bring about the correspondence of the minimum time which can occur in the instant with the maximum time which can be thought in accordance with the Aion. To limit the actualization of the event in a present without mixture, to make the instant all the more intense, taut, and instantaneous since it expresses an unlimited future and an unlimited past. This is the use of represen-tation: the mime, and no longer the fortune-teller. One stops going from the greatest present toward a future and past which are said only of a smaller present; on the contrary, one goes from the future and past as unlimited, all the way to the smallest present of a pure instant which is endlessly subdivided. This is how the Stoic sage not only comprehends and wills the event, but also represents it and, by this, selects it, and that an ethics of the mime necessarily prolongs the logic of sense.</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=161&annotation=H97EK36K) 
- [N] Stoic sage comprehends, wills (proairesis), and represents (selects) the event.
- [N] Quasi-cause operates by "doubling" physical causality, embodying the event in a pure, instantaneous present (like the actor/mime).
- [N] The ethics of the mime prolongs the logic of sense by actualizing the event in the pure instant of the Aion.

> The twentieth series examines Stoic ethics, located between logic (surface) and physics (depth). It highlights divination as an art of surfaces and introduces the Stoic will (*proairesis*) and the "use of representation." This involves the sage grasping the pure event in its eternal truth (in the Aion) and then willing its actualization in a precise, instantaneous present (like an actor or mime), effectively doubling physical causality with an incorporeal quasi-causality, defining an ethics of counter-actualization.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To the extent that events are actualized in us, they wait for us and invite us in. They signal us: "My wound existed before me, I was born to embody it." 1 It is a question of attaining this will that the event creates in us; of becoming the quasi-cause of what is produced within us, the Operator; of producing surfaces and linings in which the event is reflected, finds itself again as incorporeal and manifests in us the neutral splendor which it possesses in itself in its impersonal and preindividual nature, beyond the general and the particular, the collective and the private. It is a question of becoming a citizen of the world.</mark> [Page 162](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=162&annotation=AX4SR94T)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">My misfortune is present in all events, but also a splendor and brightness which dry up misfortune and which bring about that the event, once willed, is actualized on its most contracted point, on the cutting edge of an operation. All this is the effect of the static genesis and of the immaculate conception. The splendor and the magnificence of the event is sense. The event is not what occurs (an accident), it is rather inside what occurs, the purely expressed. It signals and awaits us. In accord-ance with the three preceding determinations, it is what must be understood, willed, and represented in that which occurs.</mark> [Page 163](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=163&annotation=7BIAVA9V)

<mark class="hltr-green">Nothing more can be said, and no more has ever been said: to become worthy of what happens to us, and thus to will and release the event, to become the offspring of one's own events, and thereby to be reborn, to have one more birth, and to break</mark> [Page 163](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=163&annotation=QKVSUICK)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The actor is always acting out other roles when acting one role. The role has the same relation to the actor as the future and past have to the instantaneous present which corresponds to them on the line of the Aion. The actor thus actualizes the event, but in a way which is entirely different from the actualization of the event in the depth of things. Or rather, the actor redoubles this cosmic, or physical actualization, in his own way, which is singularly superficial-but because of it more distinct, trenchant and pure. Thus, the actor delimits the original, disengages from it an abstract line, and keeps from the cwnt only its contour and its splendor, becoming thereby the actor of one's own events-a counter-actualization.</mark> [Page 164](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=164&annotation=7NH7U9YW) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">With every event, there is indeed the present moment of its actualization, the moment in which the event is embod-ied in a state of affairs, an individual, or a person, the moment we designate by saying "here, the moment has come." The future and the past of the event are evaluated only with respect to this definitive present, and from the point of view of that which embodies it. But on the other hand, there is the future and the past of the event considered in itself, sidestepping each present, being free of the limitations of a state of affairs, impersonal and pre-individual, neutral, neither general nor particular, eventum tantum. . . . It has no other present than that of the mobile instant which represents it, always divided into past-future, and forming what must be called the counter-actualization.</mark> [Page 165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=165&annotation=UTEDCVAR) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In one case, it is my life, which seems too weak for me and slips away at a point which, in a determined relation to me, has become present. In the other case, it is I who am too weak for life, it is life which overwhelms me, scattering its singularities all about, in no relation to me, nor to a moment determinable as the present, except an impersonal instant which is divided into still-future and already-past.</mark> [Page 165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=165&annotation=SKHLIB8M) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Death has an extreme and definite relation to me and my body and is grounded in me, but it also has no relation to me at all-it is incorporeal and infinitive, impersonal, grounded only in itself. On one side, there is the part of the event which is realized and accomplished; on the other, there is that "part of the event which cannot realize its accomplishment." There are thus two accomplishments, which are like actualization and counter-actualization. It is in this way that death and its wound are not simply events among other events. Every event is like death, double and impersonal in its double. "It is the abyss of the present, the time without present with which I have no relation, toward which I am unable to project myself. For in it I do not die. I forfeit the power of dying. In this abyss they (on) die-they never cease to die, and they never succeed in dying.</mark> [Page 166](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=166&annotation=LK73UPHL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is the "they" of impersonal and pre-individual singularities, the "they" of the pure event wherein it dies in the same way that it rains. The splendor of the "they" is the splendor of the event itself or of the fourth person. This is why there are no private or collective events, no more than there are individuals and universals, particularities and generalities. Everything is singular, and thus both collective and private, particular and general, neither individual nor universal.</mark> [Page 166](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=166&annotation=6KEMDHWK) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Only the free man, therefore, can comprehend all violence in a single act of violence, and every mortal event in a sin9le Event which no longer makes room for the accident, and which denounces and removes the power of ressentiment within the individual as well as the power of oppression within society.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is at this mobile and precise point, where all events gather together in one that transmutation happens: this is the point at which death turns against death; where dying is the negation of death, and the impersonality of dying no longer indicates only the moment when I disappear outside of myself, but rather the moment when death loses itself in itself, and also the figure which the most singular !if e takes on in order to substitute itself for me.</mark> [Page 167](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=167&annotation=QEY3IA5X) 
- [N] Events invite us to become their quasi-cause ("Operator") by producing surfaces where they can be reflected and manifest their neutral splendor.
- [N] To become worthy of what happens is to will the event, becoming the offspring of one's events, not actions.
- [N] Actualization is the event embodied in a state of affairs/individual/person in the Chronos present.
- [N] Counter-actualization is the event in itself, impersonal, pre-individual, neutral, in the Aion (past-future) represented by the mobile, dividing instant (like the actor/mime).
- [N] Death is double: personal/present (shattering the ego) and impersonal/infinitive (distancing the ego, where "they" die).
- [N] Events are singular, neither private nor collective, individual nor universal.
- [N] The free man/revolutionary transcends *ressentiment* and relates to events as a single Event, counter-actualizing them.
- [N] Transmutation occurs at the point where events gather in one, turning death against itself (dying as negation of death), allowing singular life to substitute the personal self.

> The twenty-first series explores the nature of the event as something that invites us to become its "Operator" or quasi-cause through counter-actualization. This involves willing the event in its impersonal, eternal truth (in the Aion) rather than merely undergoing its personal, temporal actualization (in Chronos). This counter-actualization is likened to the actor's performance and represents a liberation from the limitations of the individual self, especially in relation to death, allowing for a transmutation where singular life affirms itself over the merely personal.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If the order of the surface is itself cracked, how could it not itself break up, how is it to be prevented from precipitating destruction, even if this meant losing all accompanying benefits-the organization of language and even life itself? How could we not reach the point at which we can only spell letter by letter and cry out in a sort of schizophrenic depth, but no longer speak at all? If there is a crack at the surface, how can we prevent deep life from becoming a demolition job and prevent it from becoming it as a matter "of course"? Is it possible to maintain the inherence of the incorporeal crack while taking care not to bring it into existence, and not to incarnate it in the depth of the body?</mark> [Page 171](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=171&annotation=XG589KWH)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Well then, are we to speak always about Bousquet's wound, about Fitzgerald's and Lawry's alcoholism, Nietzsche's and Artaud's madness while remaining on the shore? Are we to become the professionals who give talks on these topics? Are we to wish only that those who have been struck down do not abuse themselves too much? Are we to take up collections and create special journal issues? Or should we go a short way further to see for ourselves, be a little alcoholic, a little crazy, a little suicidal, a little of a guerilla-just enough to extend the crack,</mark> [Page 171](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=171&annotation=366K99RP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">but not enough to deepen it irremedially? Wherever we turn, every-thing seems dismal. Indeed, how are we to stay at the surface without staying on the shore? How do we save ourselves by saving the surface and every surface organization, including language and life? How is this politics, this full guerilla waifare to be attained? (How much we have yet to learn from Stoicism .... )</mark> [Page 172](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=172&annotation=XLXU4R6Y) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Alcoholism does not seem to be a search for pleasure, but a search for an effect which consists mainly in an extraordinary hardening of the present.</mark> [Page 172](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=172&annotation=YJ7QUYZ6) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In its hardness, the present has lost its hold and faded. It no longer encloses anything; it rather distances every aspect of the other moment.</mark> [Page 173](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=173&annotation=4SQQG4VC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The hardening of the present (I have) is now related to an effect of the flight of the past ( drunk). Everything culminates in a "has been." This effect of the flight of the past, this loss of the object in every sense and direction, constitutes the depressive aspect of alcoholism.</mark> [Page 173](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=173&annotation=4VYTIBMH)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What gives alcoholism an exemplary value, however, among all these events of the same type, is that alcohol is at once love and the loss of love, money and the loss of money, the native land and its loss. It is at once object, loss ef object, and the law governing this loss within an orchestrated process of demolition ("of course").</mark> [Page 174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=174&annotation=J62ZF7LU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If one asks why health does not suffice, why the crack is desirable, it is perhaps because only by means of the crack and at its edges thought occurs, that anything that is good and great in humanity enters and exits through it, in people ready to destroy themselves-better death thanÂ· the health which we are given.</mark> [Page 174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=174&annotation=ZCA5A39F) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The eternal truth of the event is grasped only if the event is also inscribed in the flesh. But each time we must double this painful actualization by a counter-actualization which limits, moves, and transfigures it. We must accompany ourselvesfirst, in order to survive, but then even when we die. Counter-actualization is nothing, it belongs to a buffoon when it operates alone and pretends to have the value of what could have happened. But, to be the mime of what effectively occurs, to double the actualization with a counter-actualization, the identification with a distance, like the true actor and dancer, is to give to the truth of the event the only chance of not being confused with its inevitable actualization. It is to give to the crack the chance of flying over its own incorporeal surface area, without stopping at the bursting within each body; it is, finally, to give us the chance to go farther than we would have believed possible. To the extent that the pure event is each time imprisoned forever in its actualization, counteractualization liberates it, always for other times.</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=175&annotation=BXSFNJRZ)

- [N] Counter-actualization doubles actualization, adding distance and transfiguring it, giving the crack the chance to operate at the surface without collapsing into bodily depth.

> The twenty-second series addresses the fragility of the surface and the threat of breakdown (likened to cracking porcelain) and explores how to maintain the surface organization of sense in the face of inherent fault lines ("the crack"). Using alcoholism as an example, it shows how events inscribed in the flesh can lead to destructive actualization. Counter-actualization is proposed as the means to double this process, allowing the incorporeal crack to operate at the surface and liberate the event from its painful realization, enabling thought and a form of "great Health" beyond conventional notions.

### Twenty-Third Series of the Aion

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Third Series of the Aion</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=176&annotation=SF8FRY4U) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) in accordance with Chronos, only the present exists in time. Past, present, and future are not three dimensions of time; only the present fills time, whereas past and future are two dimensions relative to the present in time.</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=176&annotation=NRU3BRMH) 
- [N] Chronos 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Chronos is an encasement, a coiling up of relative presents, with God as the extreme circle or the external envelope. Inspired by the Stoics, Boethius said that the divine present complicates or comprehends the future and the past.</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=176&annotation=UETQVD7C) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) Inside Chronos, the present is in some manner corporeal. It is the time of mixtures or blendings, the very process of blending: to temper or to tcmporalize is to mix.</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=176&annotation=CEVSBV27) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) Chronos is the regulated movement of vast and profound presents.</mark> [Page 177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=177&annotation=HDB7DYJV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Is there not already in the Stoics this dual attitude of confidence and mistrust, with respect to the world, corresponding to the two types of mixtures-the white mixture which conserves as it spreads, and the black and confused mixture which alters? In the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, the alternative frequently resounds: is this the good or the bad mixture? This question finds an answer only when the two terms end up being indifferent, that is, when the status of virtue (or of health) has to be sought elsewhere, in another direction, in another element-Aion versus Chronos.</mark> [Page 177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=177&annotation=2FXL35U3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">time has only the present with which to express the internal subversion of the present in time, precisely because it is internal and deep; Chronos must still express the revenge taken by future and past on the present in terms of the present, because these are the only terms it comprehends and the only terms that affect it. This is its own way of wanting to die.</mark> [Page 178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=178&annotation=UGTE77FN) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Having been a corporeal mixture, Chronos has become a deep break. In this sense the adventures of the present manifest themselves in Chronos, in agreement with the two aspects of the chronic present-absolute and relative movement, global and partial present: in relation to itself, in depth, insofar as it bursts asunder and contracts (the movement of schizophrenia); and in relation to its more or less vast extension, in virtue of a delirious future and a delirious past ( the movement of manic depres-sion). Chronos wants to die, but has it not already given way to another reading of time?</mark> [Page 178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=178&annotation=KDN3ES74) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) In accordance with Aion, only the past and future inhere or subsist in time. Instead of a present which absorbs the past and future, a future and past divide the present at every instant and subdivide it ad infinitum into past and future, in both directions at once.</mark> [Page 178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=178&annotation=BUWE4JWP) 
- [N] Aion 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Whereas Chronos expressed the action of bodies and the creation of corporeal qualities, Aion is the locus of incorporeal events, and of attributes which are distinct from qualities. Whereas Chronos was inseparable from the bodies which filled it out entirely as causes and matter, Aion is populated by effects which haunt it without ever filling it up. Whereas Chronos was limited and infinite, Aion is unlimited, the way that future and past are unlimited, and finite like the instant. Whereas Chronos was inseparable from circularity and its accidents-such as blockages or precipitations, explosions, disconnections, and indurations-Aion stretches out in a straight line, limitless in either direction. Always already passed and eternally yet to come, Aion is the eternal truth of time: pure emptyform ef time, which has freed itself of its present corporeal content and has thereby unwound its own circle, stretching itself out in a straight line. It is perhaps all the more dangerous, more labyrinthine, and more tortuous for this reason.</mark> [Page 179](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=179&annotation=CDNLWRQI) 
- [N] Aion 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) It is this new world of incorporeal effects or surface effects which makes language possible.</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=180&annotation=AR6VRN7I) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Pure events ground language be-cause they wait for it as much as they wait for us, and have a pure, singular, impersonal, and pre-individual existence only inside the language which expresses them.</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=180&annotation=Q37G9HIT) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The most general operation of sense is this: it brings that which expresses it into existence; and from that point on, as pure inhcrencc, it brings itself to exist within that which expresses it. It rests therefore with the Aion, as the milieu of surface effects or events, to trace a frontier between things and propositions; and the Aion traces it with its entire straight line. Without it, sounds would fall back on bodies, and propositions themselves would not be "possible." Language is rendered possible by the frontier which separates it from things and from bodies (including those which speak).</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=180&annotation=IGS6CNBW) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">First, the entire line of the Aion is run through by the Instant which is endlessly displaced on this line and is always missing from its own place.</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=180&annotation=PMH5UE2Y) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Second, the instant extracts singularities from the present, and from individuals and persons which occupy this present.</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=180&annotation=JLMU627E) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Third, the straight line which extends simultaneously in two directions traces the frontier between bodies and language, states of affairs and propositions.</mark> [Page 181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=181&annotation=Q57I436Y) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sense and event are the same thing-except that now sense is related to propositions. It is related to propositions as what is expressible or expressed by them, which is entirely different from what they signify, manifest, or denote. It is also entirely different from their sonorous qualities, even though the independence of sonorous qualities from things and bodies may be exclusively guaranteed by the entire organization of the sense-event.</mark> [Page 181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=181&annotation=6J7JL7GM) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The entire organization, in its three abstract moments, runs from the point to the straight line, and from the straight line to the surface: the point which traces the line; the line which forms the frontier; and the surface which is developed and unfolded from both sides.</mark> [Page 181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=181&annotation=VW6BUWJJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) Many movements, with a fragile and delicate mechanism, intersect: that by means of which bodies, states of affairs, and mixtures, consi-dered in their depth, succeed or fail in the production of ideal surfaces; and conversely, that by means of which the events of the surface are actualized in the present of bodies (in accordance with complex rules) by imprisoning first their singularities within the limits of worlds, individuals, and persons.</mark> [Page 181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=181&annotation=PEZCKGJJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The notion of the present has therefore several meanings: the measureless or dislocated present as the time of depth and subversion; the variable and measured present as the time of actualization.</mark> [Page 182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=182&annotation=VJ48W4PP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This present of the Aion representing the instant is not at all like the vast and deep present of Chronos: it is the present without thickness, the present of the actor, dancer, or mime-the pure perverse "moment." It is the present of the pure operation, not of the incorporation. It is not the present of subversion or actualization, but that of the counter-actualization, which keeps the former from overturning the latter, and the latter from being confused with the former, and which comes to duplicate the lining (redoubler la doublure).</mark> [Page 182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=182&annotation=UKXYASIN) 
- [N] Chronos is the time of the corporeal, of mixtures, of the regulated present (circular). It expresses internal subversion and wants to die.
- [N] Aion is the time of the incorporeal, of events/effects, subsisting as past-future that infinitely divides the present (straight line). It is unlimited and finite like the instant.
- [N] Aion makes language possible by providing the frontier between things and propositions, and by existing as the medium for pure, singular, impersonal events that language expresses.
- [N] The Aion is characterized by: the endlessly displaced Instant; the extraction of singularities from the present; and the straight line that forms the frontier between bodies and language.
- [N] Sense/event is the expressible of propositions, distinct from denotation, manifestation, signification, and even sonorous qualities.
- [N] The organization of sense/event has three abstract moments: point, line, and surface, corresponding to nonsense, the frontier, and the unfolded surface where sense is distributed.
- [N] The movements of producing surfaces from depth and actualizing events in the present intersect.
- [N] There are multiple meanings of "present" (dislocated/subversive depth, measured/actualizing in bodies, instantaneous/counter-actualizing in Aion).
- [N] The Aion present is the instantaneous present of counter-actualization, a pure operational moment that duplicates the lining of actualization.

> The twenty-third series contrasts the two readings of time: Chronos (the circular, corporeal time of the present, mixtures, and regulated movement) and Aion (the straight, incorporeal time of the past-future, events/effects, and infinite division). Aion is the milieu that makes language possible by providing the frontier between things and propositions. The organization of sense/event in Aion involves a point, line, and surface, culminating in the pure, instantaneous present of counter-actualization, which differs from the presents of depth or actualization.

### Twenty-Fourth Series of the Communication of Events

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Fourth Series of the Communication of Events</mark> [Page 183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=183&annotation=KR69TZS3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Stoic paradox is to affirm destiny and to deny necessity.</mark> [Page 183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=183&annotation=AQEZ8ZUI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What brings destiny about at the level of events, what brings an event to repeat another in spite of all its difference, what makes it possible that a life is composed of one and the same Event, despite the variety of what might happen, that it be traversed by a single and same fissure, that it play one and the same air over all possible tunes and all possible words-all these are not due to relations between cause and effect; it is rather an aggregate of noncausal correspondences which form a system of echoes, of resumptions and resonances, a system of signs-in short, an expressive quasi-causality, and not at all a necessitating causality.</mark> [Page 184](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=184&annotation=IQAK6CQ4) 
- [N] Destiny in events is due to expressive quasi-causality (noncausal correspondences, echoes, resonances, signs), not necessitating causality.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In short, the relations of events among themselves, from the point of view of an ideational or noematic quasi-causality, first expresses noncausal correspondencealogical compatibilities or incompatibilities.</mark> [Page 185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=185&annotation=KVR9ADQX) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">Compossibility must be defined in an original manner, at a pre-individual level, by the convergence of series which singularities of events form as they stretch themselves out over lines of ordinary points.</mark> [Page 185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=185&annotation=VMRKBTNL) 
- [N] Compossibility defined by convergence of singularity series (pre-individual level).

<mark class="hltr-orange">lncompossibility must be defined by the divergence of such series: if another Sextus than the one we know is incompossible with our world,</mark> [Page 185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=185&annotation=IIWA74KK) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">it is because he would correspond to a singularity the series of which would diverge from the series of our world, clustered about the Adam, the Judas, the Christ, and the Leibniz that we know.</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=186&annotation=8GZIHPZ3) 
- [N] Incompossibility defined by divergence of singularity series.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Two events are compossible when the series which are organized around their singular-ities extend in all directions; they are incompossible when the series diverge in the vicinity of constitutive singularities.</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=186&annotation=2NG5EQVY) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We are rather faced with a positive distance of different elements: no longer to identify two contraries with the same, but to affirm their distance as that which</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=186&annotation=TP7RLZIJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">relates one to the other insofar as they are "different."</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=187&annotation=U7E7ZCUL) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Nietzsche exhorts us to live health and sickness in such a manner that health be a living perspective on sickness and sickness a living perspective on health; to make of sickness an exploration of health, of health an investigation of sickness: "Looking from the perspective of the sick toward healthier concepts and values and, conversely, looking again from the fullness and self-assurance of a rich life down into the secret work of the instinct of decadence-in this I have had the longest training, my truest experiences; if in anything, I became master in this. Now I know how, have the know-how, to reverse perspectives . ... "</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=187&annotation=HG3XVIYT) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">With Nietzsche, on the contrary, the point of view is opened onto a divergence which it affirms: another town corresponds to each point of view, each point of view is another town, the towns are linked only by their distance and resonate only through the divergence of their series, their houses and their streets. There is always another town within the town. Each term becomes the means of going all the way to the end of another, by following the entire distance. Nietzsche's perspective-his perspectivism-is a much more profound art than Leib-niz's point of view; for divergence is no longer a principle of exclusion, and disjunction no longer a means of separation. lncompossibility is now a means of communication.</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=188&annotation=VVY5347U) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Instead of a certain number of predicates being excluded from a thing in virtue of the identity of its concept, each "thing" opens itself up to the infinity of predicates through which it passes, as it loses its center, that is, its identity as concept or as self. 6 The communication of events replaces the exclusion of predicates.</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=188&annotation=EKG94C2M) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Everything happens through the resonance of disparates, point of view on a point of view, displacement of perspective, differentiation of difference, and not through the identity of contraries.</mark> [Page 189](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=189&annotation=Q25PRRTQ) 

<mark class="hltr-green">If the self is the principle of manifestation, in relation to the proposition, the world is the principle of denotation, and God the principle of signification. But sense expressed as an event is of an entirely different nature: it emanates from nonsense as from the always displaced paradoxical instance and from the eternally decentered ex-centric center. It is a pure sign whose coherence excludes merely, and yet supremely, the coherence of the self, world, and God. 7 This quasi-cause, this surface nonsense which traverses the divergent as such, this aleatory point which circulates throughout singularities, and emits them as pre-individual and impersonal, does not allow God to subsist. It does not tolerate the subsistence of God as an original individuality, nor the self as a Person, nor the world as an element of the self and as God's product. The divergence of the affirmed series forms a "chaosmos" and no longer a world; the aleatory point which traverses them forms a counter-self, and no longer a self; the disjunction posed as a synthesis exchanges its theological principle for a diabolic principle. It is the decentered center which traces between the series, and for all disjunctions, the merciless straight line of the Aion, that is, the distance whereupon the castoffs of the self, the world, and God are lined up: the Grand Canyon of the world, the "crack" of the self, and the dismembering of God. Upon this straight line of the Aion, there is also an eternal return, as the most terrible labyrinth of which Borges spoke-one very different from the circular or monocentered return of Chronos: an eternal return which is no longer that of individuals, persons, and worlds, but only of pure events which the instant, displaced over the line, goes on dividing into already past and yet to come. Nothing other than the Event subsists, the Event alone, Eventum tantum for all contraries, which communicates with itself through its own distance and resonates across all of its disjuncts.</mark> [Page 190](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=190&annotation=63BJF8WY) 
- [N] Sense/event relates to a pure sign emanating from nonsense (paradoxical instance, aleatory point, ex-centric center).
- [N] This quasi-cause/surface nonsense excludes the coherence of the self, world, and God.
- [N] Divergent series form a "chaosmos" (not world); the aleatory point is a counter-self (not self).

- [N] Communication of events replaces the exclusion of predicates based on conceptual identity.

> The twenty-fourth series explores the communication of events through expressive quasi-causality, contrasting it with necessitating causality. It redefines compossibility and incompossibility based on the convergence or divergence of singularity series at a pre-individual level. Unlike philosophies based on identity and exclusion, this perspective, aligned with Nietzschean perspectivism, affirms divergence and positive distance, where incompossible events communicate through resonance. Sense/event is seen as a pure sign emanating from nonsense (the paradoxical element), establishing a "chaosmos" and a "counter-self" that excludes the traditional coherence of self, world, and God, culminating in an eternal return of pure events on the line of the Aion.

### Twenty-Fifth Series of Univocity

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Fifth Series of Univocity</mark> [Page 191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=191&annotation=N2WR3UKI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Incompatibility is born only with individuals, persons, and worlds in which events are actualized, but not between events themselves or between their a-cosmic, impersonal, and preindividual singularities. Incompatibility does not exist between two events, but between an event and the world or the individual which actualizes another event as divergent.</mark> [Page 191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=191&annotation=GKSKPTM7) 
- [N] Incompatibility arises from the actualization of divergent events in individuals/worlds, not between events/singularities themselves.

<mark class="hltr-green">It would be necessary for the individual to grasp herself as event; and that she grasp the event actualized within her as another individual grafted onto her. In this case, she would not understand, want, or represent this event without also understanding and wanting all other events as individuals, and without representing all other individuals as events. Each individual would be like a mirror for the condensation of singularities and each world a distance in the mirror. This is the ultimate sense of counter-actualization. This, moreover, is the Nietzschean discovery of the indi-vidual as the fortuitous case,</mark> [Page 192](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=192&annotation=XLAXDJTK) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Klossowski takes it up and restores it, in an essential relation to the eternal return. Witness the vehement oscillations which upset the individual as long as he seeks only his own center and does not see the circle of which he himself is a part; for if these oscillations upset him, it is because each corresponds to an individuality other than that which he takes as his own from the point of view of the undiscoverable center. Hence, an identity is essentially fortuitous and a series of individualities must be traversed by each, in order that the fortuity make them completely necessary."</mark> [Page 192](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=192&annotation=V28XE73I) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">As the individual affirms the distance, she follows and joins it, passing through all the other individuals implied by the other events, and extracts from it a unique Event which is once again herself, or rather the universal freedom. The eternal return is not a theory of qualities and their circular transformations, but rather the theory of pure events and their linear and superficial condensation.</mark> [Page 192](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=192&annotation=G88KJ9QL) 
- [N] Eternal Return 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The gray butterfly understands so well the event "to be hidden" that, by remaining in the same place, plastered to the trunk of a tree, it covers the whole distance separating it from the "to invigorate" of the black butterfly; it also causes the other event to resonate as individual, within its own individuality as an event, and as a fortuitous case.</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=193&annotation=Q5HNE7R8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">You come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my friend. . . . Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy .... The future exists now ... but I am your friend. . . . For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care.</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=193&annotation=HMIQNJWN) 
- [N] Borges 

<mark class="hltr-green">The univocity of Being does not mean that there is one and the same Being; on the contrary, beings are multiple and different, they are always produced by a disjunctive synthesis, and they themselves are disjointed and divergent, membra disjuncta. The univocity of Being signifies that Being is Voice that it is said, and that it is said in one and the same "sense" of everything about which it is said. That of which it is said is not at all the same, but Being is the same for everything about which it is said. It occurs, therefore, as a unique event for everything that happens to the most diverse things, Eventum tantum for all events, the ultimate form for all of the forms which remain disjointed in it, but which bring about the resonance and the ramification of their disjunc-tion. The univocity of Being merges with the positive use of th</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=193&annotation=QXTCHD3S) 

<mark class="hltr-green">disjunctive synthesis which is the highest affirmation. It is the eternal return itself, or-as we have seen in the case of the ideal game-the affirmation of all chance in a single moment, the unique cast for all throws, one Being and only for all forms and all times, a single instance for all that exists, a single phantom for all the living, a single voice for every hum of voices and every drop of water in the sea.</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=194&annotation=65GHGU7A) 
- [N] Being is a single voice, said in a single sense, not a single substance, but of multiplicities of beings and events, it is the eternal return, affirmation of all chance in a single moment #ðŸ”¥ 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Univocity means the identity of the noematic attribute and that which is expressed linguistically-event and sense.</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=194&annotation=PV8YIMHR) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Being pure saying and pure event, univocity brings in contact the inner surface of language (insistence) with the outer surface of Being (extra-Being). Univocal Being inheres in language and happens to things; it measures the internal relation of language with the external relation of Being. Neither active nor passive, univocal Being is neutral. It is extra-Being, that is, the minimum of Being common to the real, the possible, and the impossible. A position in the void of all events in one, an expression in the nonsense of all senses in one, univocal Being is the pure form of the Aion, the form of exteriority which relates things and propositions.</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=194&annotation=JYPERNNX) 
- [N] Beautiful 

<mark class="hltr-orange">In short, the univocity of Being has three determinations: one single event for all events; one and the same aliquid for that which happens and that which is said; and one and the same Being for the impossible, the possible, and the real.</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=194&annotation=IZSEHVW3) 
- [N] Univocity of Being means Being is said in one sense *of* multiple, different beings/events, not that there is one being.
- [N] Univocity is the affirmation of all chance in a single cast (eternal return), the unity of the Event for all events.
- [N] Counter-actualization is the process where the individual grasps herself as event and other events as individuals, reflecting singularities and distance.
- [N] Identity becomes fortuitous; the individual traverses a series of individualities (Klossowski).
- [N] Univocity is the identity of sense and event (noematic attribute and linguistic expression).
- [N] Univocal Being is pure saying/event, neutral, extra-Being (common to real/possible/impossible), the form of Aion, relating things and propositions.
- [N] Univocity has three determinations: single event for all, single "aliquid" for what happens/is said, same Being for impossible/possible/real.

> The twenty-fifth series introduces the concept of the Univocity of Being, which means Being is said in a single sense of multiple, different beings and events, rather than there being a single, identical Being. This univocity is the positive use of disjunction, the affirmation of all difference, and merges with the eternal return as a unique Event for all events. Counter-actualization allows the individual to participate in this univocity, grasping herself as event and traversing a series of individualities. Univocal Being is a pure saying/event, extra-Being, neutral, and the form of the Aion, relating things and propositions.

### Twenty-Sixth Series of Language

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Sixth Series of Language</mark> [Page 195](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=195&annotation=L9P5ATZJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Events make language possible. But making possible does not mean causing to begin. We always begin in the order of speech, but not in the order of language, in which everything must be given simultaneously and in a single blow. There is always someone who begins to speak. The one who begins to speak is the one who manifests; what one talks about is the denotatum; what one says are the significations. The event is not any of these things: it speaks no more than it is spoken of or said. Nevertheless, the event does belong to language, and haunts it so much that it does not exist outside of the propositions which express it. But the event is not the same as the proposition; what is expressed is not the same as the expression. It does not preexist it, but pre-inheres in it, thus giving it a foundation and a condition.</mark> [Page 195](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=195&annotation=6N7HZD5I) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">without the event all of this would be only noise-and an indistinct noise.</mark> [Page 196](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=196&annotation=X96YKHZS) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus the entire organization of language presents three figures: the metaphysical or transcendental swface, the incorporeal abstract line, and the decentered point. These figures correspond to surface effects or events; at the surface, the line of sense immanent to the event; and on the line, the point of nonsense, surface nonsense, being co-present with sense.</mark> [Page 197](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=197&annotation=YIXMSIS6) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The verb has two poles: the present, which indicates its relation to a denotable state of affairs in view of a physical time characterized by succession; and the infinitive, which indicates its relation to sense or the event in view of the internal time which it envelops.</mark> [Page 198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=198&annotation=5S52LHBP) 
- [N] The verb has two poles: present (relation to state of affairs/Chronos) and infinitive (relation to sense/event/Aion).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The pure infinitive</mark> [Page 198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=198&annotation=MZRUS262) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">is the Aion, the straight line, the empty form, and the distance; it permits no distinction of moments, but goes on being divided formally in the double and simultaneous direction of the past and the future. The infinitive does not implicate a time internal to language without expressing the sense or the event, that is to say, the set of problems raised by language. It connects the interiority of language to the exteriority of being. It inherits therefore the communication of events among themselves. As for univocity, it is transmitted from Being to language, from the exteriority of Being to the interiority of language. Equivocity is always the equivocity of nouns. The Verb is the univocity of language, in the form of an undetermined infinitive, without person, without present, without any diversity of voice. It is poetry itself. As it expresses in language all events in one, the infinitive verb expresses the event of language-language being a unique event which merges now with that which renders it possible.</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=199&annotation=YQUHFZJ7) 
- [N] The pure infinitive is the Aion, expressing sense/event (problems of language), connecting language's interiority to Being's exteriority.
- [N] The verb (infinitive form) is the univocity of language, expressing the event of language (language as a unique event) and inheriting the communication of events.
- [N] Language organization: metaphysical surface, incorporeal line of sense, decentered point of nonsense (surface nonsense).
- [N] Events make language possible by pre-inhering in propositions as their condition.
- [N] Without the event, language would be mere noise.
- [N] Univocity passes from Being to language via the infinitive verb.

> The twenty-sixth series explores the relationship between events and language. Events make language possible by pre-inhering in propositions as their condition, preventing language from being mere noise. The organization of language is structured around surface effects/events (metaphysical surface), the line of sense (incorporeal line), and the point of nonsense (decentered point). The verb, particularly in its pure infinitive form, is the univocity of language, expressing sense/event and transmitting univocity from Being to language, representing language itself as a unique event.

### Twenty-Seventh Series of Orality

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Seventh Series of Orality</mark> [Page 200](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=200&annotation=EVTWY23R) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">we find ourselves confronted with a final task: to retrace the history which liberates sounds and makes them independent of bodies.</mark> [Page 200](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=200&annotation=9S2FYNH2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">sound takes on a conventional value inside denotation, a customary value in manifestation, and an artificial value in signification, only because it establishes its independence at the surface from the higher authority of expressivity.</mark> [Page 201](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=201&annotation=JMM2TJUE) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Now, the history of depths begins with what is most terrifying: it begins with the theater of terror whose unforgetable picture Melanie Klein painted. In it, the nursing infant is, beginning with his or her first year, stage, actor, and drama at once. Orality, mouth, and breast are initially bottomless depths. Not only are the breast and the entire body of the mother split apart into a good and a bad object, but they are aggressively emptied, slashed to pieces, broken into crumbs and alimen-tary morsels. The introjection of these partial objects into the body of the infant is accompanied by a projection of aggressiveness onto these internal objects, and by a re-projection of these objects into the mater-nal body. Thus, introjected morsels are like poisonous, persecuting, explosive, and toxic substances threatening the child's body from within and being endlessly reconstituted inside the mother's body. The necessity of a perpetual re-introjection is the result of this. The entire system of introjection and projection is a communication of bodies in, and through, depth. Orality is naturally prolonged in cannibalism and anality in the case of which partial objects are excreta, capable of exploding the mother's body, as well as the body of the infant. The bits of one are always the persecutors of the other, and, in this abominable mixture which constitutes the Passion of the nursing infant, persecutor and persecuted are always the same. In this system of mouth-anus or aliment-exrement, bodies burst and cause other bodies to burst in a universal cesspool.</mark> [Page 201](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=201&annotation=B28A22YM) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We call this world of introjected and projected, alimentary and excremental partial internal objects the world of simulacra. Melanie Klein describes it as the paranoid-schizoid position of the child. It is succeeded by a depressive position which characterizes a dual progress, since the child strives to reconstitute a complete aood</mark> [Page 201](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=201&annotation=LQQLTZS3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">object and to identify himself with this object. The child strives thus to achieve a corresponding identity, even if in this new drama he has to share the threats, sufferings, and all the passions undergone by the good object. Depressive "identification," with its confirmation of the superego and formation of the ego, replaces paranoid and schizoid "introjection-projection." Everything is prepared at last for the access to a sexual position marked by Oedipus, through new dangers. In it, the libidinal impulses tend to be disengaged from destructive impulses and to invest through "symbolization" always better organized objects, interests, and activities.</mark> [Page 202](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=202&annotation=THYGX3VU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What the schizoid position opposes to bad partial objects-introjected and projected, toxic and excremental, oral and anal-is not a good object, even it if were partial. What is opposed is rather an organism without parts, a body without organs, with neither mouth nor anus, having given up all introjection or projection, and being complete, at this price. At this point, the tension between id and ego is formed.</mark> [Page 202](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=202&annotation=H3MTXSSE) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If we assume that the schizophrenic, with all the language he has acquired, regresses to this schizoid position, we should not be surprised to find again in schizophrenic language the duality and complementarity of words-passions, splintered excremental bits, and of words-actions, blocks fused together by a principle of water or fire. Henceforth, everything takes place in depth, beneath the realm of sense, between two nonsenses of pure noise-the nonsense of the body and of the splintered word, and the nonsense of the block of bodies or of inarticulate words (the "that doesn't make sense," fa n 'a pas de sens, acting as the positive process of both sides). The same duality of complementary poles is found again in schizophrenia between reiter-ations and perseverations, between jaw-grinding and catatonia, for example. The first bears witness to internal objects and to the bodies they break to pieces-the same bodies which break them to pieces; the second manifests the body without organs.</mark> [Page 203](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=203&annotation=S9K9XR37) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The good object has another "position." It belongs to the heights, it holds itself above, and does not allow itself to fall without also changing its nature.</mark> [Page 203](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=203&annotation=6NIGIQR4) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The superego does not begin with the first introjected objects, as Melanie Klein says, but rather with this good object which holds itself aloft.</mark> [Page 203](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=203&annotation=6N8GVPJD) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the good object of the heights maintains-a struggle with the partial objects in which force is at stake in the violent confrontation of two dimensions. The body of the infant is like a den full of introjected savage beasts which endeavour to snap up the good object; the good object, in turn, behaves in their presence like a pitiless bird of prey.</mark> [Page 204](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=204&annotation=S7R3LZBY) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Such is the vortex id-ego-superego, in which every one receives as many blows as he metes out and which character-izes the manic-depressive position.</mark> [Page 204](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=204&annotation=JY28UL65) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The good object is by nature a lost object. It only shows itself and appears from the start as already lost, as havin9 been lost. Its eminent unity lies here. Only as lost, the good object confers its love on the one who is able to find it for the first time as "found again" ("retrouve") (the ego which identifies with it); and it confers its hate on the one who approaches it aggressively as something "discovered" or "exposed," and yet already there (the ego taking the side of internal objects).</mark> [Page 205](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=205&annotation=IWKN79VT) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The good object is cruel (the cruelty of the superego) to the extent that it ties together all these moments of love and hate conferred from on high with an instance which turns its face away and offers its gifts (dons) only as gifts offered once before (redonnes).</mark> [Page 205](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=205&annotation=8Q56MXF9) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The manic-depressive position, being determined by the good object, presents therefore all sorts of new characteristics at the same time that it inserts itself in the paranoid-schizoid position. This is no longer the deep world of the simulacra, but rather that of the idol on high. It is no longer a matter of mechanisms of introjection and projection, but of identification. And it is no longer the same Spaltun9 or division of the ego.</mark> [Page 206](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=206&annotation=KQ2DSISK) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">what guarantees the first rough sketch of this sculpture, and the first stage in the formation of a language, is the good object of the depressive position up above. For it is this object that, from among all the sounds of the depth, extracts a Voice. If we take into consideration the characteristics of the good object (of being found only as lost, of appearing for the first time as already there, etc.) it seems that they are necessarily gathered into a voice which speaks and comes from on high.</mark> [Page 207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=207&annotation=RQWNIUZU) 
- [N] First stage of dynamic genesis 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For the child, the first approach to language consists in grasping it as the model of that which preexists, as referring to the entire domain of what is already there, and as the familial voice which conveys tradition, it affects the child as a bearer of a name and demands his insertion even before the child begins to understand.</mark> [Page 207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=207&annotation=TF4W8FKD) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">And so we are left outside sense, far from it, this time in a pre-sense (pre-sens) of heights: the voice does not yet have at its disposal the univocity which would make it a language, and, having unity only in virtue of its eminence, rests entangled in the equivocity of its denotations, the analogy of its significations, and the ambivalence of its manifestations.</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=208&annotation=7HVU9MLQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">F5QSYV8K</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=208&annotation=F5QSYV8K) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Truth to tell, to the extent that it denotes the lost object, one does not know what the voice denotes; one does not know what it signifies since it signifies the order of preexisting entities; one does not know what it manifests since it manifests withdrawal into its principle, or silence. It is at once the object, the law of the loss, and the loss itself.</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=208&annotation=UYMMFZ3M) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is the paradox of the voice which at the same time marks the insufficiency of all theories of analogy and equivocity: it has the dimensions of a language without having its condition; it awaits the event that will make it a language. It is no longer a noise, but is not yet language.</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=208&annotation=YF8FIYQZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We constantly relive in our dreams the passage from noise to voice; observers have correctly noted how sounds reaching the sleeper were organized in the voice ready to awaken him. 6 We are schizophrenic while sleeping, but manic-depressive when nearing the point of awak-ening.</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=208&annotation=YF8FIYQZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is not necessary to wonder whether echoes, constraints, and thefts are primary or only secondary in relation to automatic phenomena. This is a false problem since what is stolen from the schizophrenic is not the voice; what is stolen by the voice from on high is, rather, the entire sonorous, prerncal system that he was able to make into his "spiritual automaton."</mark> [Page 209](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=209&annotation=BX9PHQ4W) 
- [N] The history of liberating sounds from bodies leads to understanding language.
- [N] Sound becomes independent at the surface through expressivity.
- [N] Psychoanalytic stages (Melanie Klein) offer a history of depths: paranoid-schizoid position (world of simulacra, introjection-projection of partial, excremental objects, depth duality of action/passion, nonsense of noise/blocks), depressive position (reconstitution of a good object, identification, manic-depressive vortex, idol on high), and access to Oedipus (symbolization, disengagement of drives).
- [N] The good object belongs to the heights, is a lost object, and is the first stage in language formation, extracting a Voice from the sounds of depth.
- [N] The Voice (from on high) is pre-sense, lacking univocity, entangled in equivocity, analogy, and ambivalence, representing a language dimension without its full condition, awaiting the event that makes it language.
- [N] The passage from noise to voice is relived in dreams; it's a shift from schizophrenic depth to manic-depressive proximity to awakening/heights.
- [N] The voice from on high steals the sonorous system from the schizophrenic "spiritual automaton."

> The twenty-seventh series traces a dynamic genesis of language starting from the "primary order" of depth, referencing Melanie Klein's psychoanalytic stages. It describes the transition from the paranoid-schizoid position (world of simulacra, introjection-projection, depth) to the depressive position (good object, identification, height). This latter stage extracts a "Voice" from the noises of depth, representing a "pre-sense" located at the heights, which has the *dimensions* of language but lacks its full condition (univocity), awaiting the event that will make it language proper.

### Twenty-Eighth Series of Sexuality

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Eighth Series of Sexuality</mark> [Page 210](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=210&annotation=9DFTFFFU) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">The word "partial" has two senses. First, it designates the state of introjected objects and the corresponding state of the drives attached to these objects. It also designates elective bodily zones and the state of the drives which find in them a "source." These are objects which may themselves be partial: the breast or finger for the oral zone, excrements for the anal zone.</mark> [Page 210](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=210&annotation=N95FRNES) 

<mark class="hltr-orange">A stage is characterized by a type of activity which assimilates other activities and realizes in a certain mode a mixture of drives-absorption, for example, in the first oral stage, which also assimilates the anus, or excretion during the anal stage, which prolongs it, and which also takes over the mouth. Zones, on the contrary, represent the isolation of a territory, activities which "invest" this territory, and drives which now find in it a distinct source.</mark> [Page 210](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=210&annotation=IGJJPUTR) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But the essential difference is that zones are facts c!_[ the surface, and that their organization implies the constitution, the discovery, and the investment of a third dimension which is no longer either depth or height.</mark> [Page 211](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=211&annotation=QW32RNM4) 
- [N] Erogenous zones are surface phenomena, unlike introjected objects/stages (depth).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">sexual perversion is distinct from the depressive ascent or conversion and from the schizophrenic subversion.</mark> [Page 211](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=211&annotation=EWTU2G4K) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Precisely because the entire surface does not preexist, sexuality in its first (pregenital) aspect must be defined as a veritable production of partial surfaces. The auto-eroticism which corresponds to it must be characterized by the object of satisfaction projected onto the surface and by the little narcissistic ego which contemplates it and indulges in it.</mark> [Page 211](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=211&annotation=V5P44SPL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Each erogenous zone is inseparable from one or several singular points, from a serial development articulated around the singularity and from a drive investing this territory. It is inseparable from a partial object "projected" onto the territory as an object of satisfaction (ima9e), from an observer or an ego bound to the territory and experiencing satisfaction, and from a mode of joining up with other zones. The entire surface is the product of this connection, and, as we will see, this poses specific problems. Precisely because the entire surface does not preexist, sexuality in its first (pregenital) aspect must be defined as a veritable production of partial surfaces. The auto-eroticism which corresponds to it must be characterized by the object of satisfaction projected onto the surface and by the little narcissistic ego which contemplates it and indulges in it.</mark> [Page 211](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=211&annotation=46S8PGQG) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The fact is though that height renders possible a constitution of partial surfaces, like many-colored fields unfolding beneath the wings of an airplane. As for the superego, despite all its cruelty, it is not without kindness with respect to the sexual organization of superficial zones, to the extent that it can assume that the libidinal drives are there separated from the destructive drives ef the depths.</mark> [Page 212](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=212&annotation=RXQHUK5M) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Of course, the sexual or libidinal drives were already at work in the depths. But it is important to understand the state of their mixturewith the drives of preservation, on one hand, and drives of death, on the other.</mark> [Page 212](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=212&annotation=RAIEZWBS) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In this sense, all three drives merge together in depth, under such conditions that preservation provides the drive, sexuality provides the substitutive object, and destruction provides the whole reversible relation. But precisely because preservation is, at its foundation, threatened by this system fo which it has become involved (wherein to eat becomes to be eaten), we see the whole system being displaced; death is recovered as a drive inside the body without organs at the same time that this dead body is eternally conserved and nourished while it is sexually born of itself. The world of oral-anal-urethral depth is the world of a revolving mixture which can truly be called bottomless, as it bears witness to a perpetual subversion.</mark> [Page 213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=213&annotation=TVPMPDTB) 

<mark class="hltr-green">When we link sexuality to the constitution of surfaces or zones, what we mean to say is that the libidinal drives find the occasion for an at least apparent double liberation, which is expressed precisely in autoeroticism. On one hand, they free themselves from the alimentary model of the drives of preservation, since they find new sources in the erogenous zones and new objects in the images projected onto these zones: thus, for example, sucking (le suqotement) which is distinguished from suction (la succion). On the other hand, they free themselves from the constraint of the destructive drives to the extent that they get involved in the productive labor of surfaces and in new relations with these new pellicular objects.</mark> [Page 213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=213&annotation=W74LA6Y5) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We must then consider the twice liberated libido as a veritable supeificial energy. We should not believe, however, that the other drives have disappeared, that they do not continue their work in depth, or especially that they do not find an original position in the new system.</mark> [Page 213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=213&annotation=M3IW28LV) 
- [N] Sexuality is defined by the constitution/production of partial surfaces (erogenous zones), distinct from depth and height.
- [N] Auto-eroticism involves projecting objects onto these surfaces.
- [N] Sexuality involves libidinal drives seemingly liberated from preservation and destructive drives, operating as superficial energy.
- [N] Drives of preservation, sexuality, and death are mixed in depth (subversion, e.g., eating=being eaten).
- [N] Sexuality operates on a third dimension (surface) distinct from depth (paranoid-schizoid) and height (depressive).

> The twenty-eighth series positions sexuality as operating on a *surface* dimension, distinct from the depth (introjection/projection, oral-anal mixture, subversion) and height (good object, identification, ascent) described previously. Pregenital sexuality, particularly auto-eroticism, involves the production of partial surfaces and the apparent liberation of libidinal drives as superficial energy, marking a shift to a new organization beyond the mere mixing of drives in depth.

### Twenty-Ninth Series Good Intentions Are Inevitably Punished

<mark class="hltr-purple">Twenty-Ninth Series-Good Intentions Are Inevitably Punished</mark> [Page 216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=216&annotation=SVHE8AQC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is necessary therefore to imagine Oedipus not only as innocent, but as full of zeal and good intentions-a second Hercules who will experience a similarly painful experience.</mark> [Page 216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=216&annotation=VTMDH2EH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">One is never certain that the destructive drives, which continue to act under the sexual drives, are not directing the work of the latter. The phallus as an image at the surface risks constantly being recuperated by the penis of the depths or the penis of the heights. Thus, it risks being castrated as phallus, since the penis of the depths devours and castrates, and the penis of the heights frustrates. There is therefore a double menace of castration through preoedipal regression (castration-devouring, castration-deprivation). The line traced by the phallus risks being swallowed up inside the deep Spaltun9.</mark> [Page 216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=216&annotation=FKVU4925)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Incest risks also returning to the state of eventration of the mother and of the child, or to a cannibalistic mixture where the one who eats is also eaten. In short, the schizoid and even the depressive position-the anxiety of one and the culpability of the other-threaten endlessly the Oedipal complex. As Melanie Klein says, anxiety and culpability are not born of the incestuous affair. They would, rather, prevent its formation and compromise it constantly.</mark> [Page 216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=216&annotation=3CTW4HI8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The constitution of surfaces has also as a principle and intention the separation of sexual drives from destructive drives from the depths, and, in this respect, it encounters a certain complacency on the part of the superego or of the good object of the heights. Thus, the dangers of the oedipal affair must also derive from an internal evolution. Moreover, the risks of confusion or of corporeal mixture, invoked by the first response, take on their full meaning only in relation to these new dangers generated by the oedipal enterprise itself. In short, this affair necessarily creates a new anxiety which is proper to it, a new culpability or a new castration which is not reduced to either of the preceding cases-and to which alone the name "castration complex" corresponds in relation to Oedipus. The constitution of surfaces is the most innocent, hut "innocent" does not signify "without perversity."</mark> [Page 217](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=217&annotation=ZICKULNU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The child receives the phallus as an image that the good ideal penis projects over the genital zone of his body. He receives this gift (narcissistic overinvestment of an organ) as the condition by which he would be able t~ bring about the integration of all his other zones. But the fact is that he cannot accomplish the production of the surface without introducing elsewhere some very important changes. In the first place, he splits the gift-making idol or good object of the heights. Both parents were combined earlier, in accordance with for</mark> [Page 217](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=217&annotation=563CGS45) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">mulas dearly analyzed by Melanie Klein: the maternal body of the depths comprised a multiplicity of penises as partial internal objects; and especially, the good object of the heights was, as a complete organ, both penis and breast-mother provided with a penis, father provided with a breast.</mark> [Page 218](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=218&annotation=H8DD3RWH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">On one hand, the child identifies the mother with the wounded body, being the primary dimension of the complete, good object (the wounded body must not be confused with the shattered or fragmented body of the depths); and on the other hand, the child identifies the father with the last dimension, that is, with the good object retired into its height. As for the wounded body of the mother, the child wishes to repair it, with his restorative phallus and make it unharmed. He wishes to recreate a surface to this body at the same time that he creates a surface for his own body. As for the withdrawn object, he wishes to bring about its return, to render it present with his evocative phallus.</mark> [Page 218](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=218&annotation=6L84LXIJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the unconscious, everyone is the offspring of divorced parents, dreaming of restoring the mother and bringing about the return of the father, pulling him back from his retreat: it seems to us that this is the basis of what Freud called the "familial romance" and its linkage with the Oedipus complex. Never has the child, in his narcissistic confidence, had better intentions, never again will he feel as good. Far from casting himself into an agonizing and guilt-ridden venture, never, in this position, had he believed himself so close to dispelling the anxiety and culpability of the previous positions. It is true that he assumes the father's place and takes the mother as the object of his incestuous desire. But the incest relationship, almost by proxy, does not imply here violence: neither eventration nor usurpation, but rather a surface relation, a process of restoration and evocation in which the phallus brings about a lining at the surface.</mark> [Page 218](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=218&annotation=WAUHD5ZT) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Oedipus is a tragedy, but we must be able to imagine the tragic hero as gay and innocent, and as starting off on the right foot. Incest with the mother through restoration and the replacement of the father through evocation are not only good intentions (for it is with the Oedipus complex that the intention-the moral notion par excellence -is born). As intentions, they are inseparable extensions of what is apparently the most innocent activity, which, from the point of view of the child, consists of creating a total surface from all his partial surfaces, making use of the phallus projected by the good penis from above, and causing the parental images to benefit from this projection. Oedipus is Herculean because, as peace-maker, he too wishes to form a kingdom of surfaces and of the earth to fit his size. He believed that he had warded off the monsters of the depth and allied himself with the powers from on high. And in his endeavour, the restoration of the mother and the summoning of the father are the targets: this is the true Oedipus complex.</mark> [Page 219](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=219&annotation=25U9ARWW) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The superego as the good object begins to condemn the libidinal drives themselves. In fact, in his desire for incest-restoration, Oedipus saw. What he saw (once the cleavage has been made), but should not have seen, is that the wounded body of the mother is not only wounded by the internal penises it contains; insofar as its surface is lacking a penis, it is wounded like a castrated body. The phallus as a projected image, which bestowed a new force on the child's penis, designates, on the contrary, a lack in the mother. This discovery threatens the child in an essential manner, for it signifies (on the other side of the cleavage) that the penis is the property of the father. Wishing to summon the father back and to make him present, the child betrays the paternal essence of withdrawal. This essence could not be found but only as if recovered-recovered in absence and in forgetfulness-but never given</mark> [Page 219](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=219&annotation=5LFS47AL) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">in a simple presence of the "thing" which would eliminate forgetting. 2 It becomes therefore true, at this moment, that by wishing to restore the mother, the child has in fact castrated and eventrated her; and that by wishing to bring back the father, the child has betrayed and killed him, transformed him into a cadaver. Castration, death by castration, becomes the child's destiny, reflected by the mother in this anguish he now experiences, and inflicted by the father in this culpability he now submits to as a sign of vengeance.</mark> [Page 220](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=220&annotation=4DGVK2EH)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This castration, which alone merits the name "complex," is distinguished in principle from the two other castrations: that of depth, through devouring-absorption; and that of height, through privation-frustration. It is a castration through "adsorption," a surface phenomenon: like, for example, the surface poisons, those of the tunic and the skin which bum Hercules</mark> [Page 220](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=220&annotation=LF2DBG6T) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">As a surface phenomenon, it marks the failure or illness, the premature mold, the way in which the surface prematurely rots, and the surface line rejoins the deep Spa/tung or incest rejoins the cannibalistic mixture of the depths-all of this, in conformity with the first reason which we invoked earlier.</mark> [Page 220](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=220&annotation=UJGYAUSR) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Far from being an agency of the depths, intention is the phenomenon of the entire surface, or the phenomenon which adequately corresponds to the coordination of the physical surfaces. The very notion of Image, after having designated the superficial object of a partial zone, and then the phallus projected on the genital zone, and the pellicular parental images born of a cleavage, comes finally to designate action in general.</mark> [Page 221](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=221&annotation=GR6X69WY) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In short, intention as an Oedipal category does not at all oppose a determined action to another, as, for example, a particular willed action to a particular accomplished action. On the contrary, it takes the totality of every possible action and divides it in two, projects it on two screens, as it determines each side according to the necessary exigencies of each screen. On one hand, the entire image of action is projected on a physical surface, where the action itself appears as willed and is found determined in the forms of restoration and evocation; on the other, the entire result of the action is projected on a metaphysical surface, where</mark> [Page 221](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=221&annotation=9HHE58UE)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In fact, along with the "narcissistic wound," that is, when the phallic line is transformed into the trace of castration, the libido, which invested the ego of secondary narcissism at the surface, undergoes a particularly important transmutation-that which heud called "desexualization." Desexualized energy appeared to Freud as nourishing the death instinct and as conditioning the mechanism of thought. We must therefore grant a dual value to the themes of death and castration. We must grant the value they have with respect to the preservation or liquidation of the Oedipus complex and in the organization of the definitive genital sexuality, upon its own surface and in its relations to the previous dimensions (the schizoid and depressive positions). But we must also grant the value which they take on as the origin of desexualized energy and the original manner by which this energy reinvests them on its new metaphysical surface, or surface of pure thought. This second process -which, to a certain extent, is independent of the others, since it is not directly proportional to the success or failure of the liquidation of Oedipus-corresponds in its first aspect to what is called "sublimation," and in its second aspect to what is called "symbolization."</mark> [Page 222](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=222&annotation=ZNPSJ6W9)

> The twenty-ninth series examines the Oedipus complex not as a story of transgression but of "good intentions" aiming to constitute a total surface and integrate erogenous zones via the phallus. This process, however, is undermined by the persistence of depth drives and leads to a new form of castration (by "adsorption," a surface phenomenon) and the transformation of the phallic line into a trace of castration. This "narcissistic wound" results in desexualization, the investment of the death instinct, and the emergence of a metaphysical surface for thought (sublimation, symbolization), though this "crack of thought" risks collapsing back into the depths.

- [N] Phantasm is a pure event (result of action/passion), neither action nor passion itself.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Events are effects (thus, for example, the castration "effect," and the parricide "effect"...). But insofar as they are effects, they must be tied not only with endogenous causes, but with exogenous causes as well, effective states of affairs, actions really undertaken, and passions or contemplations effectively actualized.</mark> [Page 224](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=224&annotation=57V85U4Y) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Neither active nor passive, neither internal nor external, neither imaginary nor real-phantasms have indeed the impassibility and ideality of the event. In light of this impassibility, they inspire in us an unbearable waiting-the waiting of that which is going to come about as a result, and also of that which is already in the process of coming about and never stops coming about.</mark> [Page 225](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=225&annotation=53YXCRSN)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">psychoanalysis in general is the science of events, on the condition that the event should not be treated as something whose sense is to be sought and disentangled. The event is sense itself, insofar as it is disengaged or distinguished from the states of affairs which produce it and in which it is actualized.</mark> [Page 225](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=225&annotation=UTZQVU24) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For it is with Oedipus that the event is disengaged from its causes in depth, spreads itself at the surface and connects itself with its quasi-cause from the point of view of a dynamic genesis. It is the perfect crime, the eternal truth, the royal splendor of the event-each one of which communicates with all the others in the variants of one and the same phantasm.</mark> [Page 226](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=226&annotation=TKE2884J) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">And if it is indeed at the point where the actualization cannot accomplish or the cause produce that the entire event resides, it is at the same point also that it offers itself to counteractualization; it is here that our greatest freedom lies-the freedom by which we develop and lead the event to its completion and transmutation, and finally become masters of actualizations and causes. As the science of pure events, psychoanalysis is also an art of counter-actualizations, sublimations, and symbolizations.</mark> [Page 226](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=226&annotation=3SPVN6JH) 
- [N] Psychoanalysis is the science and art of events, counter-actualizations, sublimations, and symbolizations.

<mark class="hltr-orange">2) The second characteristic of the phantasm is its position in relation to the ego, or rather the situation of the ego in the phantasm itself.</mark> [Page 226](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=226&annotation=MJTDTFL5) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Although the ego may appear occasionally in the phantasm as acting, as undergoing an action, or as a third observing party, it is neither active nor passive and does not allow itself at any moment to be fixed in a place, even if this place were reversible.</mark> [Page 226](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=226&annotation=83XSCZNC) 

<mark class="hltr-green">That which is beyond the active and the passive is not the pronominal, but the result-the result of actions and passions, the surface effect or the event. What appears in the phantasm is the movement by which the ego opens itself to the surface and liberates the a-cosmic, impersonal, and pre-individual singularities which it had imprisoned. It literally releases them like spores and bursts as it gets unburdened.</mark> [Page 227](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=227&annotation=3LZTTE4J) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This neutrality, that is to say, this movement by which singularities are emitted, or rather restored by an ego which is dissolved or adsorbed at the surface, belongs essentially to the phantasm.</mark> [Page 227](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=227&annotation=V7DANV7L) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus, the individuality of the ego merges with the event of the phantasm itself, even if that which the event represents in the phantasm is understood</mark> [Page 227](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=227&annotation=YTQ5TDPB) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">as another individual, or rather as a series of other individuals through which the dissolved ego passes. The phantasm is inseparable therefore from the toss of the dice or from the fortuitous instances which it enacts.</mark> [Page 228](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=228&annotation=PVNAVG8R) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">And the famous grammatical traniformations (such as those of President Schreber or those of sadism or voyeurism) register each time the rising up of singularities distributed in disjunctions, all of them, in each case, communicating in the event and all events communicating in one event, as for example in the case of the throws of the dice in the same cast. We find once again here an illustration of the principle of positive distance, with the singularities which stake it out, and of an affirmative usage of the disjunctive synthesis (and not a synthesis of contradiction).</mark> [Page 228](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=228&annotation=7JWYM8UU) 
- [N] Grammatical transformations (Schreber, sadism, voyeurism) register the rising of singularities and affirmative disjunctive synthesis.

<mark class="hltr-orange">3) It is not an accident that the development inherent in the phantasm is expressed in a play of grammatical transformations.</mark> [Page 228](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=228&annotation=7D5ZD49Y) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is not the case that the phantasm is said or signified; the event 'presents as many differences from the propositions which express it as from the state of affairs in which it occurs. The fact is, though, that it does not exist outside of a proposition which is at least possible, even if this proposition has all of the characteristics of a paradox or nonsense; it also inheres in a particular element of the proposition. This element is the verb-the infinitive form of the verb. The phantasm is inseparable from the infinitive mode of the verb and bears witness thereby to the pure event.</mark> [Page 228](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=228&annotation=UQYPC46R) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">From this pure and undetermined infinitive, voices, moods, tenses, and persons will be engendered. Each one of them will be engendered within disjunctions representing in the phantasm a variable combination of singular points, and constructing around these singularities an instance of solution to the specific problem-the problem of birth, of the difference of the sexes, or the problem of death.</mark> [Page 229](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=229&annotation=IRW6JZGU) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Once an infinitive has been determined in a phantasm (for example, "to live," "to absorb," or "to give"), she investigates several types of connection: the subject-object connection, the active-passive conjunction, the affirmation-negation disjunction, or the type of temporalization of which each one of these verbs is capable ("to live," for example, has a subject, but one that is not an agent and that has no differentiated object). She is therefore able to classify these verbs in an order which runs from the least to the most determined, as if a general infinitive which is taken to be pure were progressively specified according to the differentiation of formal grammatical relations.4 This is how Aion is peopled by events at the level of singularities which are distributed over its infinitive line.</mark> [Page 229](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=229&annotation=587RUCSZ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It seems to us, precisely, that the phantasm, properly speaking, finds its origin only in the ego of the secondary narcissism, along with the narcissistic wound, the neutralization, the symbolization, and the sublimation which ensue. In this sense, it is inseparable not only from grammatical transformations, but also from the neutral infinitive as the ideational material of these transformations. The phantasm is a surface phenomenon and, moreover, a phenomenon which is formed at a certain moment in the development of surfaces. For this reason, we have opted for the word "simulacrum" in order to designate the objects of depth (which are already no longer "natural objects"), as well as the becoming which corresponds to them and the reversals by which they are characterized.

> The thirtieth series defines the phantasm as a pure event, a result of action/passion, characterized by ideality and impassibility. Psychoanalysis is the science and art of these events and their counter-actualization. The phantasm operates at the surface, where the ego dissolves and liberates pre-individual singularities, expressing itself through grammatical transformations linked to the infinitive verb. Originating with secondary narcissism, the phantasm is a surface phenomenon distinct from simulacra (depth) and idols (height), reflecting the processes of desexualization, sublimation, and symbolization.

### Thirty-First Series of Thought

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-First Series of Thought</mark> [Page 231](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=231&annotation=FDLGWPQI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">First, the phantasm covers the distance between psychic systems with ease, going from consciousness to the unconscious and vice versa, from the nocturnal to the diurnal dream, from the inner to the outer and conversely, as if it itself belonged to a surface dominating and articulating both the unconscious and the conscious, or to a line connecting and arranging the inner and the outer over two sides.</mark> [Page 231](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=231&annotation=U3KHHRJV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Second, the phantasm returns easily to its own origin and, as an "originary phantasm," it integrates effortlessly the origin of the phantasm (that is, a question, the origin of birth, of sexuality, of the difference of the sexes, or of death ... ). 1 This is because it is inseparable from a displacement, an unfolding, and a development within which it carries along its own origin.</mark> [Page 231](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=231&annotation=84DWEEHM) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nothing is finalized like the phantasm; nothing finalizes itse!f to such an extent.</mark> [Page 231](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=231&annotation=IFTS8HLB)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The (oedipal) intention was to restore, to bring about, and to coordinate its own physical surfaces; but all of this was still located within the domain of lmageswith the narcissistic libido and the phallus as a surface projection. The result is to castrate the mother and to be castrated, to kill the father and to be killed, along with the transformation of the phallic line in the trace of castration and the corresponding dissipation of all the images (mother-world, father-god, ego-phallus).</mark> [Page 232](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=232&annotation=YR2X7PSV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus, the beginning is truly in the void; it is suspended in the void. It is with-out. The paradoxical situation of the beginning, here, is that it is itself a result, and that it remains external to that which it causes to begin. This situation would afford no "way out," had not castration transformed the narcissistic libido into desexualized energy. This neutral or desexualized energy constitutes the second screen, the cerebral or metaphysical surface on which the phantasm is going to develop, begin anew with a beginning which now accompanies it at each step, run to its own finality, represent pure events which are like one and the same Result of the second degree.</mark> [Page 232](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=232&annotation=P96H7XRJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The phantasm's formula is this: from the sexual pair to thought via castration. If it is true that the thinker of</mark> [Page 232](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=232&annotation=GVBPAYWV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">depths is a bachelor, and that the depressive thinker dreams of lost betrothals, the thinker of surfaces is married or thinks about the "problem" of the couple.</mark> [Page 233](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=233&annotation=K2FLTQBH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The phantasm returns to its beginning which remained external to it (castration); but to the extent that beginning itself was a result, the phantasm also returns to that from which the beginning had resulted (the sexuality of corporeal surfaces); and finally, little by little, it returns to the absolute origin from which everything proceeds (the depths). One could now say that everything-sexuality, orality, anality-receives a new form on the new surface, which recovers and integrates not only images but even idols and simulacra.</mark> [Page 233](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=233&annotation=XBW5DW8G) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To be precise, the phantasm goes from the figurative to the abstract; it begins with the figurative, but must be continued in the abstract. The phantasm is the process of the constitution of the incorporeal. It is a machine for the extraction of a little thought, for the distribution of a difference of potential at the edges of the crack, and for the polarization of the cerebral field. As it returns to its external beginning (deadly castration), it is always beginning again its internal beginning (the movement of desexualization). In this way, the phantasm has the property of bringing in contact with each other the inner and the outer and uniting them on a single side. This is why it is the site of the eternal return. It mimics endlessly the birth of a thought, it begins a new desexualization, sublimation, and symbolization, caught in the act of bringing about this birth. Without this intrinsic repetition of beginnings, the phantasm could not integrate its other, extrinsic beginning.</mark> [Page 234](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=234&annotation=YCEI97WJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Why glory? What kind of metamorphosis is it, when thought invests (or reinvests) that which is projected over its surface with its own desexualized energy? The answer is that thought does it in the guise of the Event. It does it with the part of the event that we should call nonactualizable, precisely because it belongs to thought and can be accomplished only by thought and in thought. There arise then aggressions and voracities which transcend what was happening in the depths of hodies; desires, loves, pairings, copulations, and intentions which tran</mark> [Page 234](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=234&annotation=3WH2PHLP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">scend everything happening at the surface of bodies; and finally, powerlessnesses and deaths which transcend all that could have happened. This is the incorporeal splendor of the event as that entity which addresses itself to thought, and which alone may invest it-extraBeing.</mark> [Page 235](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=235&page=235&annotation=P3NVXUMB) 

<mark class="hltr-green">In short, metamorphosis is the liberation of the nonexistent entity for each state of affairs, and of the infinitive for each body and quality, each subject and predicate, each action and passion. Metamorphosis (sublimation and symbolization) consists, for each thing, in the liberation of an aliquid which is the noematic attribute and that which can noetically be expressed, eternal truth, and sense which hovers over bodies. Only here to die and to kill, to castrate and to be castrated, to restore and to bring about, to wound and to withdraw, to devour and to be devoured, to introject and to project, become pure events on the metaphysical surface which transforms them, and where their infinitive is drowned out. For the sake of one single language which expresses them, and under a single "Being" in which they are thought, all the events, verbs, and expressible-attributes communicate as one inside this extraction. The phantasm recovers everything on this new plane of the pure event, and in this symbolic and sublimated part of that which cannot be actualized; similarly, it draws from this part the strength to orient its actualization, to duplicate it, and to conduct its concrete counter-actualization. For the event is properly inscribed in the flesh and</mark> [Page 235](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=235&page=236&annotation=7TXPFFEJ) 

<mark class="hltr-green">in the body, with the will and the freedom which befit the patient thinker, only in virtue of the incorporeal part containing their secret, that is, the principle, truth, finality, and quasi-cause.</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=236&annotation=38DITM7S) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is, in fact, the entire sexual surface which is intermediary between physical depth and metaphysical surface.</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=236&annotation=TF9X5C7U) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The first orientation must be determined as the orientation of psychosis, the second as that of the successful sublimation; between the two, one finds all the neuroses, in the ambiguous character of Oedipus and of castration. And it is the same thing with death: the narcissistic self regards it from two sides, according to the two figures described by Blanchot-the personal and present death, which shatters and "contradicts" the ego, as it abandons it to the destructive drives of the depths and to blows of the outside; but also the impersonal and infinitive death, which "distances" the ego, causing it to release the singularities which it contains and raising it to the death instinct on the other surface, where "one" dies, where one never succeeds in, or finishes, dying.</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=236&annotation=JECW6X8F) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The mouth is not only a superficial oral zone but also the organ of depths, the mouth-anus, the cesspool introjecting and projecting every morsel. The brain is not only a corporeal organ but also the inductor of another invisible, incorporeal, and metaphysical surface on which all events are inscribed and symbolized. 3 Between this mouth and this brain everything occurs, hesitates, and gets its orientation. Only the victory of the brain, if it takes place, frees the mouth to speak, frees it from excremental food and withdrawn voices, and nourishes it with every possible word.</mark> [Page 237](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=237&annotation=id0JECW6X8F)

> The thirty-first series explores the phantasm as a process of thought that moves from the sexual surface to a metaphysical surface, driven by desexualized energy resulting from castration. The phantasm integrates its origins, traverses psychic systems, and constitutes the incorporeal by liberating pure events (sense/aliquid/infinitive) on this new surface (sublimation/symbolization). This process, where thought invests the non-actualizable part of the event, allows the phantasm to recover and reorient elements from previous dimensions (depth, height, sexual surface), culminating in a "metamorphosis" where events are grasped in their incorporeal splendor, bridging the physical and metaphysical.

### Thirty-Second Series on the Different Kinds of Series

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-Second Series on the Different Kinds of Series</mark> [Page 238](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=238&annotation=Q8R9IQHD) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">These two aspects-sequence and block-represent the forms taken on respectively by displacement and condensation in depth, within the schizoid position. It is with sexuality, that is to say, with the release of the sexual drives, that the series begins-because the serial form is a surface organization.</mark> [Page 238](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=238&annotation=ZV82QGFR) 
- [N] The sequence and blocks of the depths, partial objects, bodies without organs, words without articulation 
- [N] Serial form begins with sexuality and is a surface organization, distinct from depth phenomena (sequence/block).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There are, first, the erogenous zones of pregenital sexuality: each one of them is organized in a series which converges around a singularity represented most often by an orifice surrounded by a mucous membrane.</mark> [Page 239](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=239&annotation=JDPLL7YS) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In each of these senses, a series linked to an erogenous zone appears to have a simple form, to be homo9eneous, to give rise to a synthesis of succession which may be contracted as such, and which in any case constitutes a simple connection.</mark> [Page 239](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=239&annotation=9SCJ6JGU) 
- [N] First kind of series: erogenous zones (pregenital), homogeneous, convergence around singularity, connective synthesis.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But second, it is clear that the problem of the phallic coordination of the erogenous zones comes to complicate the serial form: without doubt, the series prolong one another and converge around the phallus as the image imposed on the genital zone. The genital zone has its own series. It is inseparable, however, from a complex form which subsumes under it hetero9eneous series, now that a condition of continuity or conver9ence has replaced homogeneity; it gives rise to a synthesis of coexistence and coordination and constitutes a conjunction of the subsumed series.</mark> [Page 239](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=239&annotation=4ADMG6CW) 
- [N] Second kind of series: phallic coordination (Oedipal), complex form, heterogeneous, convergence around the phallus, conjunctive synthesis.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Third, we know that the phallic coordination of surfaces is necessarily accompanied by oedipal affairs which in turn emphasize parental images.</mark> [Page 240](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=240&annotation=5EANU776) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The importance of this new moment or relation could not be too greatly stressed, since it animates the Freudian theory of the event, or rather of the two series of events. This theory consists first in showing that a traumatism presupposes the existence of at least two independent events, separated in time, one of them infantile and the other post-pubescent, between which a sort of resonance is produced. Under a different aspect the two events are presented as two series, one pregenital and the other oedipal, with their resonance being the process of the phantasm. 2 In our terminology, it is therefore not a question of events properly speaking, but rather of two series of independent images, whereby the Event is disengaged only through resonance of the series in the phantasm.</mark> [Page 240](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=240&page=240&annotation=SEF2G6C9) 
- [N] Freudian theory of trauma/phantasm involves resonance between two independent series (infantile/post-pubescent, pregenital/Oedipal images).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is in relation to itself that the phallus is both a defect and an excess, when the phallic line meraes with the trace of castration, and the excessive image no longer designates anything other than its own lack, as it takes away the child's penis. We are not going to repeat the characteristics of the phallus that Lacan has analyzed in several well-known texts. It is the paradoxical element or object = x, missing always its own equilibrium, at once excess and deficiency, never equal, missing its own resemblance, its own identity, its own origin, its own place, and always displaced in relation to itself. It is floating signifier and floated signified, place without occupant and occupant without place, the empty square (which can also create an excess through this void) and a supernumerary object (which can also create a lack by being this excess number). It is the phallus which brings about the resonance of the two series that we earlier called pregenital and oedipal, and which can also receive different qualifications, provided that, through all possible qualifications, the one is determined as signified and the other as signifying. 3 It is the phallus which is surface nonsense, twice nonsense, as we have seen, and which distributes sense to the two series, as something happeninB to the one and as something insistinB in the other (it is thus inevitable that the first series does not yet imply a comprehension of what is in question).</mark> [Page 242](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=242&annotation=NSZHKBQR) 
- [N] The phallus, the place without occupant and occupant without place 
- [N] The phallus is the paradoxical element (object=x, floating signifier, empty square) that causes resonance between pregenital and Oedipal series (signifying/signified).
- [N] The phallus is surface nonsense that distributes sense.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If we consider all three serial kinds - the connective synthesis on a single series, the conjunctive synthesis of convergence, and the disjunctive synthesis of resonance, we see that the third proves to be the truth and the destination of the others, to the degree that the disjunction attains its positive and affirmative use.</mark> [Page 243](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=243&annotation=FJDB2NMU) 
- [N] Third kind of series: disjunctive synthesis (resonance), the "truth" of the other two, affirmative use of disjunction.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">in the series of sexuality, something begins by being grasped as a premonition before being understood. This pre-understanding relates to what is already there.</mark> [Page 243](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=243&annotation=ZLWQ45TC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is, indeed, what the child extricates from the voice upon leaving the depressive position: an apprenticeship of formative elements before any understanding of formed linguistic units. In the continuous flow of the voice which comes from above, the child cuts out elements of different orders, free to give them a function which is still prelinguistic in relation to the whole and to the different aspects of the sexual position.</mark> [Page 244](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=244&annotation=3EBQFV66) 
- [N] Child extricates prelinguistic formative elements from the Voice.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Serge Leclaire's recent book, Psychanalyser, proposes an extremely interesting thesis: an erogenous zone (that is, a libidinal movement of the body insofar as it happens at the surface, distinguishing itself from drives of conservation and destruction) would be marked essentially by a "letter" which, at the same time, would trace its limit and subsume under it images or objects of satisfaction. "Letter" at this point assumes no mastery of language and still less a possession of writing. It is rather a question of a phonemic difference in relation to the difference of intensity which characterizes the erogenous zone. The precise example invoked by Leclaire, however, that of the letter V in the case of the Wolf Man, does not seem to go in this direction: in fact, the letter V in this example marks rather a very general movement of openness, common to several zones (to open</mark> [Page 244](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=244&annotation=IA9N4KNJ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">one's eyes, one's ears, one's mouth), and connotes several dramatic scenes rather than objects of satisfaction.6 Should we rather think, to the extent that the phoneme itself is a cluster C!f distinctive traits or differential relations, that each zone would rather be analogous to one of these traits and determined by them in relation to another zone? In this case, there would be reason for a new heralding of the body founded on phonology; the oral zone would necessarily enjoy an essential privilege, insofar as the child would make an active apprenticeship of phonemes at the same time that she would extract them from the voice.</mark> [Page 245](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=245&annotation=3SECPEMN) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">The fact is now that the oral zone would pursue its liberation and its progress in the acquisition of language only to the extent that a global integration of zones could be produced, or even an alignment of clusters and an entry of phonemes into more complex elements-what linguistics sometimes call a "concatenation of successive entities." Here we encounter the second point, and with it the problem of the phallic coordination as the second aspect of the sexual position. It is in this sense that Leclaire defines the surface of the entire body as an aggregate or sequence of letters, while the image of the phallus assures their convergence and continuity. We thus find ourselves inside a new domain. It is no longer at all a question of a simple addition of the preceding phonemes, but rather of the construction of the first esoteric words, which integrate phonemes into a conjunctive synthesis of heterogeneous, convergent, and continuous series-thus, in an example analyzed by Leclaire, the secret name "Poord'jeli," that a child creates. It seems to us at this level that the esoteric word in its entirety plays not the role of a phoneme or of an element of articulation but that of a morpheme or of an element of grammatical construction represented by the conjunctive character. It refers to the phallus as an agent of coordination. Only afterward, such an esoteric word takes on another value, or another function: as the conjunction forms an entire series, this series enters into a relation of resonance with another divergent and independent series- ')oli corps de Lili" (Lili's beautiful body). The new series corresponds to the third aspect of the sexual position, that is, to the development of Oedipus, the castration complex and the concomitant transformation of the phallus which has now become object = x. Then, and only then, the esoteric word becomes a portmanteau word insofar as it enacts a disjunctive synthesis of the two series</mark> [Page 245](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=245&page=246&annotation=W7NVGQXH) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">(the pregenital and the oedipal, that of the proper name of the subject and that of Lili), causes the two divergent series to resonate as such and ramifies them. 7 The entire esoteric word, in line with Lacan's thesis, plays now the role of a semanteme. According to this thesis, the phallus of Oedipus and of castration is a signifier which does not animate the correponding series without cropping up suddenly in the preceding series, in which it also circulates, since it "conditions the effects of the signified by its presence as signifier." We thus go from the phonemic letter to the esoteric word as morpheme, and then from this to the portmanteau word as semanteme.</mark> [Page 246](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=246&annotation=id0W7NVGQXH) 
- [N] Crazy theory involving sounds for zones or actions which by means of the phallus generate an esoteric word, a portmanteau, but important to note that these sounds do not denote, rather "conditioning-conditioned" 
- [N] Leclaire's theory: erogenous zones marked by a "letter" (phonemic difference); phallic coordination integrates zones into a surface "sequence of letters" (esoteric word as morpheme); Oedipus/castration transforms esoteric word into portmanteau (semanteme) through resonance of pregenital/Oedipal series.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the transition from schizoid position of depth to the depressive position of the heights, we went from noises to the voice. But in the surface sexual position, we go from voice to speech.</mark> [Page 246](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=246&annotation=E9WHGTEY) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The organization of the physical sexual surface has three moments which produce three types of syntheses or series: the erogenous zones and connective syntheses bearing on a homogeneous series; the phallic coordination of zones and the conjunctive synthesis bearing on heterogeneous, yet convergent and continuous series; and the evolution of Oedipus, the transformation of the phallic line into the trace of castration, and the disjunctive synthesis, bearing on divergent and resonating series. Now, these series or moments condition the three formative elements of language-phonemes, morphemes, and semantemes-as much as they are conditioned by them in a circular reaction. Nevertheless, there is still no language; we are still in a prelinguistic domain. These elements are not organized into formed linguistic units which would be able to denote things, manifest persons, and signify concepts.</mark> [Page 246](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=246&page=247&annotation=D34QI32Y) 
- [N] Three serial kinds on the physical sexual surface: connective (erogenous zones), conjunctive (phallic coordination), disjunctive (Oedipus/castration).
- [N] These series condition/are conditioned by formative elements of language (phonemes, morphemes, semantemes).
- [N] This level is prelinguistic; these elements are not yet organized into units for denotation, manifestation, signification.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">At this level, speech begins: it begins when the.formative elements c,,flan.'lua9e are extracted at the suiface,jrom the current ef voice which comesfrom abol'c. This is the paradox of speech. On one hand, it refers to language ,is lo sonwthing withdrawn which preexists in the voice from above; on</mark> [Page 246](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=246&page=247&annotation=3HGXKLAG) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the other hand, it refers to language as to something which must result, but which shall come to pass only with formed units. Speech is never equal to language. It still awaits the result, that is, the event which will make the formation effective. It masters the formative elements but without purpose, and the history which it relates, the sexual history, is nothing other than itself, or its own double. We are not yet therefore in the realm of sense. The noise of the depths was an infra-sense, an under-sense, Untersinn; the voice from the heights was a pre-sense. One could now come to believe, with the organization of the surface, that nonsense has reached that point at which it becomes sense, or takes on sense: is not precisely the phallus as object = x, this surface nonsense which distributes sense to the series which it traverses, ramifies, and makes them resonate, determining one as signifying and the other as signified?</mark> [Page 247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=247&annotation=6IW6X55P) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The organization of the physical surface is not yet sense; it is, or rather will be, a co-sense. That is to say, when sense is produced over another surface, there will also be this sense. Sexuality, according to the Freudian dualism, is that which also is-everywhere and always. There is nothing the sense of which is not also sexual, in accordance with the law of the double surface. But it is still necessary to await this result which never ends, this other surface, for sexuality to be made the concomitant, and the co-sense of sense, so that one might say "everywhere," "for all times," and "eternal truth."</mark> [Page 247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=247&annotation=W5CNUH6X) 
- [N] Sexuality (surface organization) leads from Voice to Speech.
- [N] Speech begins by extracting formative elements from the Voice.
- [N] Speech is prelinguistic, referring to language as withdrawn (Voice) and awaiting formed units (Event/result).
- [N] The physical sexual surface organization is not sense itself but a "co-sense" that will exist alongside sense when sense is produced on another surface.
- [N] Sexuality is a co-sense, always present, linked to the law of the double surface.

> The thirty-second series explores the different kinds of series that emerge with the organization of the sexual surface, distinguishing them from the sequence/block forms of depth. These include connective series (erogenous zones), conjunctive series (phallic coordination), and disjunctive series (Oedipus/castration resonance). These series, along with the phallus as the paradoxical element/surface nonsense, condition prelinguistic formative elements (phonemes, morphemes, semantemes), marking the transition from Voice to Speech. This physical surface organization is not sense itself, but a "co-sense" that anticipates and accompanies sense on a separate, metaphysical surface.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is rather the Cheshire Cat who plays this role: he is the good object, the good penis, the idol or voice of the heights. He incarnates the disjunctions of this new position: unharmed or wounded, since he sometimes presents his entire body, sometimes only his cut off head; present or absent, since he disappears, leaving only his smile, or forms itself from the smile of the good object (provisional complacency with respect to the liberation of sexual drives). In his essence, the cat is he who withdraws and diverts himself.</mark> [Page 249](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=249&annotation=GXIEJYCN)

<mark class="hltr-green">There is always a great deal of art involved in the grouping of symptoms, in the organization of a table where a particular symptom is dissociated from another, juxtaposed to a third, and forms the new figure of a disorder or illness. Clinicians who are able to renew a symptomatological table produce a work of art; conversely, artists are clinicians, not with respect to their own case, nor even with respect to a case in general; rather, they are clinicians of civilization.</mark> [Page 251](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=251&annotation=7Z83F9TY) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The neurotic can only actualize the terms and the story of his novel: the symptoms are this actualization, and the novel has no other meaning. On the contrary, to extract the non-actualizable part of the pure event from symptoms (or, as Blanchot says, to raise the visible to the invisible), to raise everyday actions and passions (like eating, shitting, loving, speaking, or dying) to their noematic attribute and their corr<'sponding pure Event, to go from the physical surface on which symptoms are played out and actualizations decided to the metaphysical surface on which the pure event stands and is played out, to go from the cause of the symptoms to the quasi-cause of the reuvre -this is the object of the novel as a work of art, and what distinguishes it from the familial novel. 2 In other words, the positive, highly affirmative charact<'r of desexualization consists in the replacement <?f psychic re9ression by speculative investment.</mark> [Page 252](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=252&annotation=ZJARSNM6) 
- [N] Work of art/novel transforms symptoms (actualization) into the pure event (non-actualizable part) on a metaphysical surface, replacing psychic regression with speculative investment.

- [N] The Cheshire Cat represents the good object/voice of the heights, embodying disjunction (present/absent, whole/cut-off).
- [N] Clinicians who create new symptomatological tables and artists are clinicians of civilization.
- [N] The work of art (novel) differs from neurotic actualization by extracting the pure event (non-actualizable) from symptoms and raising it to a metaphysical surface (speculative investment replacing psychic regression).
- [N] The artist is a clinician and pervert of civilization.

> The thirty-third series uses Alice's Adventures (specifically the Cheshire Cat as the good object/voice of the heights) to illustrate how art and literature function. Like a clinician organizing symptoms, the artist/novelist extracts the non-actualizable pure event from lived experience/symptoms and transforms it into a work of art on a metaphysical surface, a process seen as a form of speculative investment that replaces psychic regression and distinguishes the work of art from mere life.

### Thirty-Fourth Series of Primary Order and Secondary Organization

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-Fourth Series of Primary Order and Secondary Organization</mark> [Page 253](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=253&annotation=N3TC6EHN) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">r it is true that the phantasm is constructed upon at least two diverging sexual series and that it merges with their resonance, it is nevertheless the case that the two basic series (along with the object = x which traverses them and causes them to resonate) constitute only the extrinsic beginning of the phantasm. Let us call the resonance "intrinsic beginning." The phantasm develops to the extent that the resonance induces a forced movement that goes beyond and sweeps away the basic series. It has a pendular structure: the basic series traversed by the movement of the object = x, the resonance, and the forced movement of an amplitude greater than the initial movement. This initial movement is, as we have seen, the movement of Eros, which operates on the intermediary physical surface, the sexual surface, or the liberated area of sexual drives. But the forced movement which represents desexualization is Thanatos and "compulsion"; it operates between the two extremes of the original depth and the metaphysical surface, the destructive cannibalistic drives of depth and the speculative death instinct.</mark> [Page 253](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=253&page=254&annotation=YLL9DRFJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We can therefore name the entire forced movement "death instinct," and name its full amplitude "metaphysical surface." At any rate, the forced movement is not established between the basic sexual series, but rather between the two new and infinitely larger series-eating, on the one hand, and thinking, on the other, where the second always risks disappearing into the first, and the first, on the contrary, risks being projected onto the second.</mark> [Page 254](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=254&annotation=MFRLB586) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Speaking, in the complete sense of the word, presupposes the verb and passes through the verb, which projects the mouth onto the metaphysical surface, filling it with the ideal events of this surface. The verb is the "verbal representation" in its entirety, as well as the highest affirmative power of the disjunction (univocity, with respect to that which diverges). The verb, however, is silent; and we must take literally the idea that Eros is sonorous and that the death instinct is silence. In the verb, the secondary organization is brought about, and from this organization the entire ordering of language proceeds.</mark> [Page 255](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=255&annotation=7PMP4VJ3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is this whole system, point-line-surface, that represents the organization of sense and nonsense. Sense occurs to states of affairs and insists in propositions, varying its pure univocal infinitive according to the series of the states of affairs which it sublimates and from which it results, and the series of propositions which it symbolizes and makes possible.</mark> [Page 255](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=255&annotation=WUPZXRBC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For the voice gave us only denotations, empty manifestations and denotations, or pure intentions suspended in tonality. The first words gave us only formative elements, without reaching formed units. In order that there be language, together with the full use of speech conforming to the three dimensions of language, it was necessary to pass through the verb and its silence, and through the entire organization of sense and nonsense on the metaphysical surface-the last stage of the dynamic genesis.</mark> [Page 255](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=255&annotation=5C5PP7RG) 
- [N] Language requires passing through the verb and the organization of sense/nonsense on the metaphysical surface.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sexual organization already presents us with an entire point-line-surface system; and the phallus, as object = x and word = x, has the role of nonsense, distributing sense to the two basic sexual series, the pregenital and the Oedipal. This entire intermediary domain, however, seems to be neutralized by the movement of desexualization, just as the basic series of the phantasm have been by the series of amplitude. The reason is that phonemes, morphemes, and semantemes, in their original relation to sexuality, do not yet form units of denotation, manifestation, or signification. Sexuality is neither denoted, nor manifested, nor signified by them; rather, sexuality is the surface that they double, and they themselves are the doubling up which builds the surface. It is a question of a dual surface effect, of reverse and right sides, which precedes all relations between states of affairs and propositions. This is why when another surface is developed with different effects which at last found denotations, manifestations, and significations as ordered linguistic units, elements like phonemes, morphemes, and semantemes seem to tum up on this new plane, but seem to lose their sexual resonance.</mark> [Page 256](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=256&page=256&annotation=645Z3YKA)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">energy invests or reinvests an object of sexual interest as such and is thereby re-sexualized in a new way. Such is the most general mechanism of perversion, on the condition that perversion be distinguished as an art of the surface from subversion as a technique of depth.</mark> [Page 257](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=257&annotation=426UZFIY) 
- [N] Perversion as an art of the surface involves re-sexualizing an object with desexualized energy (distinct from depth subversion).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Perversion is a surface structure which expresses itself as such, without being necessarily actualized in criminal behaviors of a subversive nature. Crimes may undoubtedly follow, but only through a regression from perversion to subversion. The real problem of perversion is shown correctly in the essential mechanism which corresponds to it, that of Verleu9nun9. For if Verleu9nun9 is a question of maintaining the image of the phallus in spite of the absense of a penis, in the case of women, this operation presupposes a desexualization as the consequence of castration, but also a reinvestment of the sexual object insofar as it is sexual by means of desexualized energy: Verleu9nun9 is not an hallucination, but rather an esoteric knowledge. 2 Thus Carroll, perverse but without crime, perverse but nonsubversive, stuttering and left-handed, uses the desexualized energy of the photographic apparatus as a frightfully speculative eye, in order to invest the sexual object par excellence, namely, the little girl-phallus.</mark> [Page 257](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=257&page=257&annotation=VGSXHY97) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Repression is always the repression of one dimension by another.</mark> [Page 257](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=257&annotation=ZRD4NHDC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The return of the repressed occurs in accordance with the general mechanism of n-gression: there is regression as soon as one dimension falls back on another.</mark> [Page 258](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=258&annotation=47WIZTH2)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">tions"-the ultimate terms of regressions.</mark> [Page 259](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=259&annotation=Q4IKWP8J) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Alongside repression and the return of the repressed, we must save a place for these complex processes through which an element characteristic of a certain dimension is invested as such with the very different energy corresponding to another dimension: for example, subversive criminal conduct is inseparable from the function of the voice from above, which reinvests the destructive process of depth as if it were an obligation that is forever fixed, and orders it in the guise of the superego or of the good object (see the story of Lord Arthur Savile). 3 Perverse conduct is also inseparable from a movement of the metaphysical surface which, instead of repressing sexuality, uses desexualized energy in order to invest a sexual element as such and to .fix it with unbearable attention (the second sense of fixation).</mark> [Page 259](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=259&annotation=YWDYAGQ2) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The aggregate of surfaces constitutes the organization which is called secondary, and which is defined by "verbal representation." Verbal representation must be carefully distinguished from "object representation," because it concerns an incorporeal event and not a body, an action, a passion, or a quality of bodies. Verbal representation is, as we have seen, the representation which enveloped an expression. It is made of what is expressed and what is expressing, and conforms itself to the twisting of the one into the other. It represents the event as expressed, brings it to exist in the elements of language, and, conversely, confers on these elements an expressive value and a function as "representatives" which they did not have by themselves. The whole order of language is the result of it, with its code of tertiary determinations founded in turn on "objectal" representations (denotation, manifestation, signification; individual, person, concept; world, self, and God).</mark> [Page 259](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=259&page=260&annotation=7G3KJXFW) 
- [N] Secondary organization is the aggregate of surfaces, defined by verbal representation (of the incorporeal event), producing the order of language with its tertiary determinations (denotation, manifestation, signification etc.).

<mark class="hltr-green">From the tertiary order, we must move again up to the secondary organization, and then to the primary order, in accordance with the dynamic requirement. Take, for example, the table of categories of the dynamic genesis in relation to the moments of language: passion-action (noise); possession-privation (voice); intentionresult (speech). Secondary organization (the verb or verbal representation) is itself the result of this long itinerary; it emerges when the event knows how to raise the result to a second power, and when the verb knows how to grant elementary words the expressive value of which they were still deprived. But the entire itinerary is indicated by the primary order, where words are directly actions and passions of the body, or even withdrawn voices. They are demonic possessions or divine privations. Obscenities and insults afford an idea, by way of regression, of this chaos in which bottomless depth and unlimited. height are respectively combined. For, however intimate their liaison may be, the obscene word illustrates the direct action of one body on another which is acted upon, whereas the insult pursues all at once the one who withdraws, dispossesses this one of all voice, and is itself a voice which withdraws.</mark> [Page 260](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=260&annotation=SMYXYPCW) 
- [N] Dynamic genesis of language: primary order (depth/height, passion-action/noise, possession-privation/voice), intermediary surface (intention-result/speech), secondary organization (metaphysical surface, verb/verbal representation).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Satire is a prodigious art of regressions.</mark> [Page 260](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=260&annotation=KKZW5T69) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Height, however, prepares new values for language and affirms in it its independence and its radical difference from depth. Irony appears each time language deploys itself in accordance with relations of eminence, equivocity, or analogy. These three great concepts of the tradition are the source from which all the figures of rhetoric proceed.</mark> [Page 260](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=260&page=261&annotation=GEL2I2C9) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Once height makes the constitution of surfaces possible, along with the corresponding release of sexual drives, we believe that something happens, something capable of vanquishing irony on its own terrain-that is, on the terrain of equivocity, eminence, and analogy. It is as if there were an eminence in excess, an exaggerated equivocation, and a supernumerary analogy which, rather than being added to the others, would on the contrary ensure their closure. An equivocation such that "afterward" there can be no other equivocation-this is the sense of the expression "there is also sexuality." It is as with Dostoevsky's characters who keep on saying: please consider, dear sir, there is still this matter, and again that matter. . . . But with sexuality, one arrives at an "again" which ends every "again," one reaches an equivocation which renders the pursuit of equivocities or the continuation of ulterior analogies impossible. This is why, at the same time that sexuality is deployed over the physical surface, it makes us go from voice to speech and gathers together every word into an esoteric whole and in a sexual history which will not be designated, manifested, or signified by these words, but which rather will be strictly coextensive and co-substantial with them. This is what words represent; all the formative elements of language which exist only in relation (or in reaction) to one another-phonemes, mor</mark> [Page 261](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=261&page=262&annotation=RHLAMKBD) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">phemes, and semantemes-form their totality from the point of view of this immanent history with which they are identical. There is therefore an excessive equivocation from the point of view of the voic<" and in relation to voice: an equivocation which ends equivocity and makes language ripe for something else. This something else is that which comes from the other, desexualized and metaphysical surface, when we finally go from speech to the verb, or when we compose a unique verb in the pure infinitive-along with the assembled words. This something else is the revelation of the univocal, the advent of Univocity-that is, the Event which communicates the univocity of being to language.</mark> [Page 262](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=262&annotation=JIEJ67P5) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The univocity of sense grasps language in its complete system, as the total expresser of a unique expressed-the event. The values of humor are distinguished from those of irony: humor is the art of surfaces and of the complex relation between the two surfaces. Beginning with one excessive equivocation, humor constructs all univocity; beginning with the properly sexual equivocation which ends all equivocity, humor releases a desexualized Univocity-a speculative univocity of Being and language- the entire secondary organization in one word. 5 It is necessary to imagine someone, one-third Stoic, one-third Zen, and one-third Carroll: with one hand, he masturbates in an excessive gesture, with th<" other, he writes in the sand the magic words of the pure event open to the univocal: "Mind-I believe-is Essence-Ent-Abstract -that is-an Accident-which we-that is to say-I meant-." Thus, he makes the energy of sexuality pass into the pure asexual, without, however, ceasing to ask "What is a little girl?"-even if this question must be replaced with the problem of a work of art yet to come, which alone would give an answer.</mark> [Page 262](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=262&page=262&annotation=4VLTR8B7) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Equivocity, analogy, and eminence will no doubt recover their rights with the tertiary order, in the denotations, significations, and manifestations of everyday language submitted to the rules of good sense and common sense. As we then consider the perpetual entwining which constitutes the logic of sense, it seems that this final ordering recovers the voice of the heights of the primary process, but also that the secondary organization at the surface recov<"rs som<"thing of the most profound noises, blocks, and elements for the Univocity of sense - a brief instant for a poem without figures.

> The thirty-fourth series summarizes the dynamic genesis of language from the primary order (depth/height, noise/voice) through the intermediary sexual surface (speech, formative elements) to the secondary organization on the metaphysical surface (verb, verbal representation, formed units). The phantasm, driven by the death instinct/desexualization, is key to this process. This movement culminates in the univocity of language, the art of the verb, and the values of humor, which operate on the complex relationship between the physical and metaphysical surfaces, ultimately recovering elements from all dimensions to express the univocal event.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In very general terms, the motive of the theory of Ideas must be sought in a will to select and to choose. It is a question of "making a difference," of distinguishing the "thing" itself from its images, the original from the copy, the model from the simulacrum.</mark> [Page 265](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=265&annotation=AWCTT75B) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The purpose of division then is not at all to divide a genus into species, but, more profoundly, to select lineages: to distinguish pretenders; to distinguish the pure from the impure, the authentic from the inauthentic.</mark> [Page 266](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=266&annotation=LY6KMBS7) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is to screen the claims (preten-sions) and to distinguish the true pretender from the false one.</mark> [Page 266](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=266&annotation=8EF2MVDJ)

<mark class="hltr-green">To participate is, at best, to rank second. The celebrated Neoplatonic triad of the "Unparticipated," the participated, and the participant follows from this. One could express it in the following manner as well: the foundation, the object aspired to, and the pretender; the father, the daughter, and the fiance. The foundation is that which possesses something in a primary way; it relinquishes it to be participated in, giving it to the suitor, who possesses only secondarily and insofar as he has been able to pass the test of the foundation. The participated is what the unparticipated possesses primarily. The unparticipated gives it out for participation, it offers the participated to the participants: Justice, the quality of being just, and the just men. Undoubtedly, one must distinguish all sorts of degrees, an entire hierarchy, in this elective participation. Is there not a possessor of the third or the fourth rank, and on to an infinity of degradation culminating in the one who possesses no more than a simulacrum, a mirage-the one who is himself a mirage and simulacrum?</mark> [Page 267](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=267&annotation=ZGRQQ5WW) 
- [N] Neoplatonic triad: Unparticipated (foundation), Participated (object aspired to), Participant (pretender). Hierarchy of possession.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the totality of the Platonic motivation: it has to do with selecting among the pretenders, distinguishing good and bad copies or, rather, copies (always well-founded) and simulacra (always engulfed in dissimilarity). It is a question of assuring the triumph of the copies over simulacra, of repressing simulacra, keeping them completely submerged, preventing them from climbing to the surface, and "insinuating themselves" everywhere.</mark> [Page 269](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=269&annotation=I5KEPEXN) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In short, it is the superior identity of the Idea which founds the good pretension of the copies, as it bases it on an internal or derived resemblance.</mark> [Page 269](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=269&annotation=6357LV5P) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In short, there is in the simulacrum a becoming-mad, or a becoming unlimited, as in the Philebus where "more and less are always going a point further," a becoming always other, a becoming subversive of the depths, able to evade the equal, the limit, the Same, or the Similar: always more and less at once, but never equal. To impose a limit on this becoming, to order it according to the same, to render it similar-and, for that part which remains rebellious,</mark> [Page 270](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=270&page=271&annotation=BW75XL7H)

The Platonic copy is the Similar: the pretender who possesses in a secondary way. To the pure identity of the model or original there corresponds an exemplary similitude; to the pure resemblance of the copy there corresponds the similitude called imitative.</mark> [Page 271](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=271&annotation=CFDQUAI3) 
- [N] Platonic Model = the Same (possesses primarily), Copy = the Similar (possesses secondarily).

<mark class="hltr-green">Whether in monocentric circles or in converging series, philosophy does not free itself from the clement of representation when it embarks upon the conquest of the infinite. Its intoxication is a false appearance. It always pursues the same task, lconology, and adapts it to the speculative needs of Christianity (the infinitely small and the infinitely large). Always the selection among pretenders, the exclusion of the eccentric and the divergent, in the name of a superior finality, an essential reality, or even a meaning of history.</mark> [Page 272](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=272&annotation=TBDWFDCH) 
- [N] Philosophy (even exploring the infinite) often remains Iconology, selecting/excluding based on notions of finality, reality, meaning.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Between these basic series, a sort of imernal resonance is produced; and this resonance induces a forced movement, which goes beyond the series themselves. These are the characteristics of the simulacrum, when it breaks its chains and rises to the surface: it then affirms its phantasmatic power, that is, its repressed power. Freud has already shown how the phantasm results from at least two series, one infantile and the other post-pubescent. The affective charge associated with the phantasm is explained by the internal resonance whose bearers are the simulacra. The impression of death, of the rupture or dismembering of life, is explained by the amplitude of the forced movement which carries them along. Thus the conditions of real experience and the structures of the work of art are reunited: divergence of series, decentering of circles, constitution of the chaos which envelops them, internal resonance and movement of amplitude, aggression of the simulacra.</mark> [Page 273](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=273&annotation=4QVLB5LW)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The signal is a structure in which differences of potential are distributed, assuring the communication of disparate components: the sign is what flashes across the boundary of two levels, between two communicating series.</mark> [Page 273](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=273&annotation=HRIEKK9J) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In order to speak of simulacra, it is necessary for the heterogeneous series to be really internalized in the system, comprised or complicated in the chaos.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Let us consider the two formulas: "only that which resembles differs" and "only differences can resemble each other." These are two distinct readings of the world: one invites us to think difference from the standpoint of a previous similitude or identity; whereas the other invites us to think similitude and even identity as the product of a deep disparity. The first reading precisely defines the world of copies or representations; it posits the world as icon. The second, contrary to the first, defines the world</mark> [Page 273](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=273&page=274&annotation=ULM3UF4V)

<mark class="hltr-green">In the reversal of Platonism, resem-blance is said of internalized difference, and identity of the Different as primary power. The same and the similar no longer have an essence except as simulated, that is as expressing the functioning of the simulacrum. There is no longer any possible selection. The non-hierarchized work is a condensation of coexistences and a simultaneity of events. It is the triumph of the false pretender. It simulates at once the father, tlw pretender, and the fiance in a superimposition of masks. But the false pretender cannot be called false in relation to a presupposed model</mark> [Page 274](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=274&page=275&annotation=2JREKK99) 

<mark class="hltr-green">of truth, no more than simulation can be called an appearance or an illusion. Simulation is the phantasm itself, that is, the effect of the functioning of the simulacrum as machinery-a Dionysian machine. It involves the false as power, Pseudos, in the sense in which Nietzsche speaks of the highest power of the false. By rising to the surface, the simulacrum makes the Same and the Similar, the model and the copy, fall under the power of the false (phantasm). It renders the order of participation, the fixity of distribution, the determination of the hier-archy impossible. It establishes the world of nomadic distributions and crowned anarchies. Far from being a new foundation, it engulfs all foundations, it assures a universal breakdown (effondrement), but as a joyful and positive event, as an un-founding (effondement}: "behind each cave another that opens still more deeply, and beyond each surface a subterranean world yet more vast, more strange. Richer still ... and under all foundations, under every ground, a subsoil still more pro-found."</mark> [Page 275](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=275&annotation=C6C69W4L)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">That the Same and the Similar may be simulated does not mean that they are appearances or illusions. Simulation designates the power of producing an effect. But this is not intended only in a causal sense, since causality would remain completely hypothetical and indeterminate without the intervention of other meanings. It is intended rather in the sense of a "sign" issued from a process of signalization; it is in the sense of a "costume," or rather a mask, expressing a process of disguising, where, behind each mask, there is yet another.... Simulation understood in this way is inseparable from the eternal return, for it is in the eternal return that the reversal of the icons or the subversion of the world of representation is decided.</mark> [Page 275](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=275&page=276&annotation=NE52VBDD) 
- [N] Eternal Return 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the eternal return, one must pass through the manifest content, but only in order to reach the latent content situated a thousand feet below (the cave behind every cave ... ). Thus, what appeared to Plato to be only a sterile effect reveals in itself the intractability of masks and the impassibility of signs.</mark> [Page 276](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=276&annotation=MA2854UC) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The secret of the eternal return is that it does not express an order opposed to the chaos engulfing it. On the contrary, it is nothing other than chaos itself, or the power of affirming chaos.</mark> [Page 276](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=276&annotation=QFQKCKZ2) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To the coherence of representation, the eternal return substitutes something else entirelyits own chaodyssey (chao-errance). Between the eternal return and the simulacrum, there is such a profound link that the one cannot be understood except through the other. Only the divergent series, insofar as they are divergent, return: that is, each series insofar as it displaces its difference along with all the others, and all series insofar as they rnmplicate their difference within the chaos which is without beginning or end. The circle of the eternal return is a circle which is always exnÂ·ntric in relation to an always decentered center. Klossowski is right to say of the eternal return that it is a "simulacrum of a doctrine": it is indeed Being (f.tre), but only when "being" (etant) is the simulacrum.</mark> [Page 276](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=276&page=277&annotation=XZ696LNZ) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Thus, the eternal return is, in fact, the Same and the Similar, but only insofar as they are simulated, produced by the simulation, through the functioning of the simulacrum (will to power). It is in this sense that it reverses representation and destroys the icons. It does not presuppose the Same and the Similar; on the contrary, it constitutes the only Same-the Same of that which differs, and the only resemblance-the resemblance of the unmatched. It is the unique phantasm of all simulacra (the Being of all beings). It is the power to affirm divergence and decentering and makes this power the object of a superior affirmation. It is under the power of the false pretender causing that which is to happen again and again. And it does not make everythin9 come back. It is still selective, it "makes a difference," but not at all in the manner of Plato. What is selected are all the procedures opposed to selection; what is excluded, what is made not to return, is that which presupposes the Same and the Similar, that which pretends to correct divergence, to recenter the circles or order the chaos, and to provide a model or make a copy. For all its long history, Platonism happened only once, and Socrates fell under the blade. For the Same and the Similar become simple illusions when they cease to be simulated.</mark> [Page 277](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=277&annotation=WRTTTSTD) 
- [N] The eternal return is the Same and Similar *as simulated* by the simulacrum (Will to Power).
- [N] It constitutes the Same of difference and the resemblance of the unmatched (unlike Plato).
- [N] It is the unique phantasm of all simulacra, affirming divergence and decentering.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">he untimely is attained in relation to the most distant past, by the reversal of Platonism; in relation to the present, by the simulacrum conceived as the edge of critical modernity; in relation to the future, it is attained by the phantasm of the eternal return as belief in the future.</mark> [Page 277](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=277&annotation=7MUQ2Q37) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The artificial and the simulacrum are not the same thing. They are even opposed to each other.

<mark class="hltr-green">For there is a vast difference between destroying in order to conserve and perpetuate the established order of representations, models, and copies, and destroying the models and copies in order to institute the chaos which creates, making the simulacra function and raising a phantasm-the most innocent of all destructions, the destruction of Platonism.</mark> [Page 278](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=278&annotation=HLL4QHBL) 
- [N] The destruction of Platonism is the innocent destruction that institutes creative chaos and makes simulacra function, raising the phantasm.
- [N] Plato's theory of Ideas is motivated by a will to select and distinguish the original/copy from the simulacrum.
- [N] Platonic division aims to select lineages, distinguish pure/impure, and assure the triumph of copies (well-founded, based on Idea's identity and derived resemblance) over simulacra (engulfed in dissimilarity, becoming unlimited).
- [N] Platonism represses the simulacrum, establishing representation based on the model/foundation.
- [N] The simulacrum, when liberated, produces internal resonance, divergence, decentering, and chaos (phantasmatic power).
- [N] The world of copies is based on "only that which resembles differs" (difference based on prior similitude); the world of simulacra is based on "only differences can resemble each other" (similitude/identity product of disparity).
- [N] The reversal of Platonism means identity is of the Different, resemblance is of internalized difference; the Same/Similar are simulated.
- [N] Simulation is the phantasm, the effect of the simulacrum as a Dionysian machine, wielding the "power of the false," establishing nomadic distributions and collapsing hierarchies.
- [N] Simulation is inseparable from the eternal return, which reverses representation and affirms chaos/divergence.
- [N] The eternal return brings back only that which differs/diverges (simulacra), excluding what relies on the Same/Similar/order (Platonism).
- [N] The simulacrum (critical modernity) and the eternal return (future phantasm) achieve the untimely via reversal of Platonism (past).
- [N] The artificial (copy of copy) is distinct from the simulacrum (reversal of artificial).

> This section contrasts Plato's philosophy, motivated by a will to select and repress the simulacrum in favor of copies based on identity and resemblance (Iconology), with a philosophy that affirms the simulacrum. The simulacrum, when it rises to the surface, overturns representation, establishes nomadic distributions, and operates based on difference as primary power and simulation as the effect. This process is inseparable from the eternal return, which affirms chaos and divergence, bringing back only that which differs, in a "reversal of Platonism" that constitutes a joyful "un-founding."

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In our world, natural diversity appears in three intertwined aspects: the diversity of species; the diversity of individuals which are members of the same species; and the diversity of the parts which together compose an individual. Specificity, individuality, and heterogeneity.</mark> [Page 278](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=278&annotation=FPQ444II) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">From these three points of view, Wt' can deduce the diversity of worlds themselves: worlds are innumerable, often of different species, sometimes similar, and always composed of hl'terogeneous elements.</mark> [Page 278](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=278&annotation=5P3ILABI) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Nature, to be precise, is power. In the name of this power things exist one by one, without any possibility of their being gathered together all at once. Nor is there any possibility of their being united in a combination adequate to Nature, which would express all of it at one time. Lucretius reproached Epicurus' predecessors for having believed in Being, the One and the Whole. These concepts are the obsessions of the mind, speculative forms of belief in thefatum, and the theological forms of a false philosophy.</mark> [Page 279](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=279&annotation=XM2UR4KG)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But what is the one if not a particular perishable and corruptible object which we consider arbitrarily in isolation from every other object?

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is therefore a minimum of time, no less than a minimum of matter or a minimum of the atom. In agreement with the nature of the atom, this minimum of continuous time refers to the apprehension of thought. It expresses the most rapid or briefest thought: the atom moves "as swiftly as thought." 5 But, as a result, we must conceive of an originary direction for each atom, as a synthesis which would give to the movement of the atom its initial direction, without which there would be no collision. This synthesis is necessarily accomplished in a time smaller than the minimum of continuous time. This is the clinamen.</mark> [Page 281](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=281&annotation=AUTQFH7Z)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">for Lucretius as for Spinoza later on, the religious man displays two aspects: avidity and anguish, covetousness and culpability-a strange complex that generates crimes. The spirit's disquietude is therefore brought about by the fear of dying when we are not yet dead, and also by the fear of not yet being dead once we already are.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Bodies or atomic compounds never cease to emit particularly subtle, fluid, and tenuous elements. These seconddegree compounds are of two sorts: either they emanate from the depth of bodies, or they detach themselves from the surface of things (skins, tunics, or wrappings, envelopes or barks-what Lucretius calls simulacra and Epicurus calls idols). Insofar as they affect the animus and the anima, they account for sensible qualities. Sounds, smells, tastes, and temperatures refer especially to the emissions from the depths, whereas visual determinations, forms, and colors refer to the simulacra of the surface.</mark> [Page 285](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=285&page=286&annotation=74JKGK7H) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Noises from the depth, for example, become voices when they find in certain perforated surfaces (the mouth) the conditions of their articulation.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The theory of time and its "exhaustive" character assure the unity of the two aspects of the method. For there is a minimum of sensible time as well as a minimum of thinkable time, and in both cases a time smaller than the minimum. But, finally, the analogous times, or their analogous determinations, are organized in a gradation, a gradation, which causes us to pass from the thinkable to the sensible, and vice versa: 1) a time smaller than the minimum of thinkable time (an incerwm tempus brought ahout by the clinamen); 2) a minimum of continuous thinkable time (the speed of the atom traveling in a single direction); 3) a time smaller than the minimum of sensible time (puncwm temporis, occupied by the simulacrum); and 4) a minimum of continuous sensible time (to which the image corresponds, which assures the perception of the object).</mark> [Page 287](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=287&page=287&annotation=D6FBWLEJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is yet a third species, distinct from the emanations issued from the depth and from the simulations detached from the surface of things. These are phantasms, which enjoy a high degree of independence with respect to objects and an extreme mobility, or an extreme inconstancy in the images which they form (since they are not renewed by the constant supplies emitted by the object).

<mark class="hltr-orange">Theological phantasms are made up of simulacra which intersect spontaneously in the sky, forming immense images out of the clouds-high mountains and figures of giants.1 ~ In any case, simulacra are everywhere. We do not cease to be immersed in them, and to be battered by them as if by waves. Being very far from the objects from which they emanate, and having lost with them any direct connection, they form these grand autonomous figures. Their independence makes them all the more subject to change; one might say that they dance, that they speak, that they modify ad infinitum their tones and gestures.</mark> [Page 287](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=287&page=288&annotation=D79HXGUQ)

They are apt to merge together, to condense and dissipate, and are too swift and too tenuous to offer themselves to sight. But they are capable of supplying the animus with visions which pertain to it in its own right: centaurs, Cerberus-like creatures, and ghosts; all of the images which correspond to desire or, again and especially, dream images. Not that desire is creative here; rather, it renders the mind attentive and makes it choose the most suitable phantasm from among all of the subtle phantasms in which we are immersed.

<mark class="hltr-orange">for the third genre, the erotic phantasms, they too are constituted of simulacra issuing from very diverse objects and are apt to be condensed ("what was before a woman seems to be changed into a man in our grasp"). The image constituted by these simulacra is doubtless connected with the actual love object; but, unlike what happens in the case of the other needs, the love object cannot be either absorbed or possessed. The image alone inspires and resuscitates desire, a mirage which no longer signals a consistent reality: "But from man's aspect and beautiful bloom nothing comes into the body to be enjoyed except thin images; and this poor hope is often snatched away by the wind."</mark> [Page 288](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=288&page=288&annotation=T6BN9E4D) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Time itself is affirmed in relation to movement. This is why we speak of a time of thought in relation to the movement of the atom in the void, and of a sensible time in relation to the mobile image which we perceive, and which causes us to perceive the qualities of atomic compounds. And we speak of a time smaller than the minimum of thinkable time, in relation to the clinamen as the determination of the movement of the atom; and of a time smaller than the minimum of sensible time, in relation to simulacra as components of the image (for these components, there are even differential orders of swiftnessprofound emanations being less swift than surface simulacra, and surface simulacra being less rapid than the third species).</mark> [Page 288](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=288&page=288&annotation=DL7LUJNB) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Perhaps movement, in all of these senses, is constitutive of "events" (eventa, what Epicurus calls symptoms), in contrast with attributes or properties (conjuncta), so that time must be called the event of events, and the "symptom of symptoms," which is entailed by movement.</mark> [Page 288](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=288&page=289&annotation=75JPTWLB) 

<mark class="hltr-green">In virtue of their speed, which causes them to be and to act below the sensible minimum, simulacra produce the miraae ef a false infinite in the imaaes which they form. They give birth to the double illusion of an infinite capacity for pleasure and an infinite possibility of torment-this mixture of avidity and anguish, of cupidity and culpability, which is so characteristic of the man of religion. It is particularly with the third and swiftest species, the phantasms, that one witnesses the development of the illusion and the myths which accompany it. In a mixture of theology, eroticism, and oneirism, amorous desire possesses only those simulacra which lead it to know bitterness and torment, even into the pleasure which it wishes were infinite. Our belief in gods rests upon simulacra which seem to dance, to change their gestures, and to shout at us promising eternal punishment-in short, to represent the infinite.</mark> [Page 289](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=289&page=290&annotation=KUQSEXRL)

<mark class="hltr-green">horn Lucretius to Nietzsche, the same end is pursued and attained. Naturalism makes of thought and sensibility an affirmation. It directs its attack against the prestige of the negative; it deprives the negative of all its power; it refuses to the spirit of the negative the right to speak in the name of philosophy. The spirit of the negative made an appearance out of the sensible; and linked the intelligible to the One or the Whole. But this Whole, this One, was but a nothingness of thought, just as the appearance was a nothingness of sensation. Naturalism, according to Lucretius, is the thought of an infinite sum, all of the elements of which are not composed at once; but, conven,ely as well, it is the sensation of finite compounds which are not added up as such with one another. In these two ways, the multiple is affirmed. The multiple as multiple is the object of affirmation, just as the diverse as diverse is the object of joy. The infinite is the absolute intelligible determination (perfection) of a sum which does not form its elements into a whole. But the finite itself is the absolute sensible determination (perfection) of everything which is composed. The pure positivity of the finite is the object of the senses, and the positivity of the veritable infinite is the object of thought. There is no opposition between these two points of view, but rather a correlation. Lucretius established for a long time to come the implications of naturalism: the positivity of Nature; Naturalism as the philosophy of affirmation; pluralism linked with multiple affirmation; sensualism connected with the joy of the diverse; and the practical critique of all mystifications.</mark> [Page 291](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=291&annotation=JKM3EENM)

> This section explores Lucretius' Naturalism as a philosophy opposing Plato's iconology. Nature is presented not as unity or totality but as power, coordination, and disjunction of diverse atoms and worlds. Key concepts include the atom, the clinamen (a swerve ensuring irreducible causal plurality), and different levels of temporal minima. Simulacra, emitted from the surface, and emanations from depth, account for sensible qualities. Phantasms are autonomous simulacra creating illusions of the false infinite (religious myths, avidity/anguish). Lucretian Naturalism is fundamentally affirmative, embracing multiplicity and difference, critiquing all forms of mystification based on false notions of unity or infinite duration, laying a foundation for a philosophy of pure affirmation.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is possible to say that the animal body "hesitates," and that it proceeds by way of dilemmas. Similarly, reasoning proceeds by fits and starts, hesitates and bifurcates at each level. The body is a disjunctive syllogism; language is an egg on the road to differentiation. The body seals and conceals a hidden language, and language forms a glorious body. The most abstract argumentation is a mimicry, but the body's pantomime is a sequence of syllogisms.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What is perverse is precisely this objective power of hesitation in the body: this paw which is neither left nor right; this determination by fits and starts; this differentiation never suppressing the undifferentiated which is divided in it; this suspense which marks each moment of difference; and this immobilization which marks each moment of the fall.</mark> [Page 293](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=293&annotation=CZD5XC5W) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is no obscene in itself, says Klossowski; that is, the obscene is not the intrusion of bodies into language, but rather their mutual reflection and the act of language which fabricates a body for the mind. This is the act by which language transcends itself as it reflects a body. "There is nothing more verbal than the excesses of the flesh. . . . The reiterated description of the carnal act not only reviews the transgression, it is itself a transgression of language by language."</mark> [Page 293](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=293&annotation=JMP55R8P)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Klossowski's work derives from this: the unity of theology and pornography in this very particular sense. We must call it a superior pornology.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Klossowski's entire work moves toward a single goal: to assure the loss of personal identity and to dissolve the self. This is the shining trophy that Klossowski's characters bring back from a voyage to the edge of madness. But as it happens, the dissolution of the self ceases to be a pathological determination in order to become the mightiest power, rich in positive and salutary promises. The self is "corrupted" only because, in the first instance, it is dissolved. This happens, not only to the self which is observed and loses its identity under the gaze, but to the observer also, who is set outside of herself and is multiplied in her own gaze.</mark> [Page 295](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=295&annotation=2M4FU5AJ)

<mark class="hltr-green">of the idea of Evil. The essential relation, that is, the complicity of sight with speech appears. For what can one do, vis-a-vis doubles, simulacra, or reflections, other than speak? With respect to that which can only be seen and heard, which is never confirmed by another organ and is the object of forgetting in memory, of an Unimaginable in imagination, and of an Unthinkable in thought-what else can one do, other than speak of it? Language is itself the ultimate double which expresses all doubles-the highest of simulacra.</mark> [Page 296](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=296&annotation=PKFJSSQM)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sometimes sight induces speech, and sometimes speech leads sight.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The body is language because it is essentially "flexion." In reflection, the corporeal flexion seems to be divided, split in two, opposed to itself and reflected in itself; it appears finally for itself, liberated from everything that ordinarily conceals it.</mark> [Page 298](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=298&annotation=7274Y24U) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In an excellent scene of La Revocation, Robcrte, thrusting her hands into the tabernacle, feels them grasped by two long hands, similar to her own .... In Le Souffieur, the two Robertes fight, clasp hands, and lock fingers while an invited guest "prompts": make her separate! And Robert ce soir ends with Roberte's gesture-her holding out "a pair of keys to Victor, which he touches though never takes." This is a suspended scene, a genuinely frozen cascade, which reflects all the dilemmas and syllogisms with which "the spirits" had assailed Roberte during her rape.</mark> [Page 298](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=298&annotation=NGYX63J8) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But if the body is flexion, so too is language.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">If language imitates bodies, it is not through onomatopoeia, but through flexion. And if bodies imitate language, it is not through organs, but through flexion. There is an entire pantomime, internal to language, as a discourse or a story within the body. If gestures speak, it is first of all because words mimic gestures: "Virgil's epic poem is, in fact, a theater where words mimic the gestures and the mental states of the characters . . . . Words, not bodies, strike a pose; words, not garments, are woven; words, not armors, sparkle .... "</mark> [Page 298](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=298&page=299&annotation=KJ3BSVEC)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">language. 11 He was able to derive from this a style and a mimicry-a particular language and a particular body at once.</mark> [Page 299](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=299&annotation=GKFZLUDA) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">One theme runs through the entire work of Klossowski: the opposition between exchange and true repetition. For exchange implies only resemblance, even if the resemblance is extreme. Exactness is its criterion, along with the equivalence of exchanged products. This is the false repetition which causes our illness. True repetition, on the other hand, appears as a singular behavior that we display in relation to that which cannot be exchanged, replaced, or substituted-like a poem that is repeated on the condition that no word may be changed. It is no longer a matter of an equivalence between similar things, it is not even a matter of an identity of the Same. True repetition addresses something singular, unchangeable, and different, without "identity." Instead of exchanging the similar and identifying the Same, it authenticates the</mark> [Page 299](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=299&page=300&annotation=TWPH59HC) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">different.</mark> [Page 300](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=300&annotation=9HC63IHQ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In short, the double, the reflection, or the simulacrum opens up at last to surrender its secret: repetition does not presuppose the Same or the Similar-these are not its prerequisites. It is repetition, on the contrary, which produces the only "same" of that which differs, and the only resemblance of the different.</mark> [Page 301](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=301&annotation=W4T4233D) 

<mark class="hltr-green">This is the relation between frozen scenes and repetition. A "fall," a "difference," a "suspension" are reflected in the resumption, or in repetition. In this sense, the body is reflected in language: the characterisitic of language is to take back into itself the frozen scene, to make a "spiritual" event out of it, or rather an advent of "spirits." In language -at the heart of language-the mind grasps the body, and the gestures of the body, as the object of a fundamental repetition. Differ-ence gives things to be seen and multiplies bodies; but it is repetition which offers things to be spoken, authenticates the multiple, and makes of it a spiritual event.</mark> [Page 301](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=301&page=302&annotation=WRXU4BQB) 
- [N] Repetition (true) produces the Same of difference and the resemblance of the different (unlike exchange/false repetition).
- [N] Language reflects the body through repetition of "frozen scenes," authenticating the multiple and making it a spiritual event.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What is the dilemma? How is the disjunctive syllogism, which expresses the dilemma, made up? The body is language; but it may conceal the speech that it is-it can hide it. The body may, and ordinarily does, wish for silence with respect to its works. In this case, repressed by the body but also projected, delegated, and alienated, speech becomes the discourse of a beautiful soul that speaks of laws and virtues while keeping silent over the body. It is clear, in this case, that speech itself is pure, so to speak, but that the silence on which it rests is impure. By holding its silence, at once covering up and delegating its speech, the body delivers us over to silent imaginings.</mark> [Page 302](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=302&annotation=9E992KHH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Such is the first term of the dilemma: either Roberte keeps quiet but provokes the aggression of spirits, her silence being all the more impure as her speech is ever more so .... Or there must be an impure, obscene, and impious language in order for silence to be pure, for language to be a pure language which resides in this silence. "Speak and we disappear," say the spirits to Roberte.</mark> [Page 303](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=303&annotation=HT98CJ9V) 

<mark class="hltr-magenta">Does Klossowski simply mean that speaking prevents us from think-ing about nasty things? No; the pure language which produces an impure silence is a provocation of the mind by the body; similarly, the impure language which produces a pure silence is a revocation of the body by the mind. As Sade's heroes say, it is not the bodies which are present that excite the libertine, but rather the great idea of what is not there. In Sade, "pornography is a form of the battle of the mind against the flesh." More precisely, what is revoked in the body? Klossowski's answer is that it is the integrity of the body, and that because of this the identity of the person is somewhat suspended and volatilized.</mark> [Page 303](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=303&annotation=EUXJCVCM) 
- [N] Pure language (speaking about laws/virtues, hiding the body) provokes impure silence (aggression of spirits); impure language (obscene, impious, speaking the body) produces pure silence (dissolution of self/body integrity, innocence). This is a revocation of the body's integrity/person's identity by the mind.

<mark class="hltr-magenta">the body-language dilemma is established between two relations of the body and language. The couple "pure language/impure silence" designates a certain relation, in which language brings the identity of a person and the integrity of a body together in a responsible self, but maintains a silence about all the forces which cause the dissolution of this self. Or language itself becomes one of these forces and takes charge of all these forces, giving thereby to the disintegrated body and the dissolved self access to a silence which is that of innocence. In this case, we have the other term of the dilemma: "impure language/pure silence." In other words, the alternative is between two purities, the false and the true, the purity of responsibility and the purity of innocence, the purity of Memory and the purity of Forgetful-ness. Posing the problem from a linguistic point of view, Le Baphomet says: either the words are recalled but their sense remains obscure; or the sense appears when the memory of the words disappears.</mark> [Page 303](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=303&page=304&annotation=VJ5BMT22) 
- [N] Body-language dilemma: "pure language/impure silence" (responsible self, body integrity, repressing dissolution) vs. "impure language/pure silence" (dissolved self, disintegrated body, language as a force of dissolution, innocence). The latter aligns with true purity (innocence, forgetfulness) where sense appears without memory of words.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Death and duplicity, death and multiplicity are therefore the true spiritual determinations, or the true spiritual events. We must under-stand that God is the enemy of spirits, that the order of God runs counter to the order of spirits; in order to establish immortality and personality, in order to impose it forcefully on spirits, God must depend upon the body. He submits the spirits to the privative function of the person and to the privative function of resurrection. The outcome of God's way is "the life of the flesh." 24 God is essentially the Traitor: he commits treason against spirits, treason against breath itself, and, in order to thwart their riposte, doubles the treason by incarnating him-self. 25 "In the beginning was treason."</mark> [Page 304](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=304&page=306&annotation=BT69H8PU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is the other term of the dilemma, the system of breaths/spirits, the order of the Antichrist, which is opposed point for point to the divine order. It is characterized by the death of God, the destruction of the world, the dissolution of the person, the disintegration of bodies, and the shifting function of language which now expresses only intens-ities.</mark> [Page 306](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=306&annotation=MZX2HRJ3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thus, the dilemma finds perhaps its most acute expression: the identity of the self always refers to the identity of something outside of us; therefore, "if it is God, our identity is pure grace; if it is the ambient world where everything begins and ends by denotation, our identity is but a pure grammatical joke."</mark> [Page 306](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=306&annotation=SYZX2K2T) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In short, the sum total of the possible is an originary material from which the exclusive and complete determination of the concept of each thing is derived through disjunction.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">disjunctions have the negative value of exclusion.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It seems that breaths, in themselves and in ourselves, must be conceived of as pure intensities. In this form of intensive quantities or degrees, dead spirits have "subsistence," despite the fact that they have lost the "existence" or extension of the body. In this form they are singular, though they have lost the identity of the self. Intensities comprehend in themselves the unequal or the different-each one is already difference in itself-so that all of them are comprehended in the manifestation of every one. This is a world of pure intentions, as Baphomet explains: "no self-esteem prevails"; "every intention may yet be permeated by other- intentions"; "only the most senseless intention of the past hoping for the future could triumph over another intention"; "were another breath to come to encounter it, they would then presuppose each other, but each one according to a variable intensity ef intention."</mark> [Page 309](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=309&page=309&annotation=DYELBLFG) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The system of the Antichrist is the system of simulacra opposed to the world of identities. But, as the simulacrum dismisses identity, speaks and is spoken, it takes hold at the same time of both seeing and speaking and inspires both light and sound. It opens up to its difference and to all other differences.

In the circle of Dionysus, Christ will not return; the order of the Antichrist chases the other order away. All of that which is founded on God and makes a negative or exclusive use c!f the disjunction is denied and excluded by the eternal return. All of that which comes once and for all is referred back to the order of God. The phantasm of Being (eternal return) brings about the return only of simulacra (will to power as simulation).

> This section examines Klossowski's work as an exploration of "bodies-language," a realm where body and language mutually reflect and transgress each other through "flexion," dissolving personal identity and the self. This leads to a "pornology" that unites theology (equivocity) and perversion (power hitting the body). Klossowski contrasts false repetition (exchange, resemblance) with true repetition, which authenticates difference and produces the Same of difference. His work presents a dilemma between a "pure language/impure silence" (responsible self) and an "impure language/pure silence" (dissolved self, innocence), aligning with an "order of the Antichrist" based on simulacra, multiplicity, and the affirmative use of disjunction, contrasting with God's order of identity and negative exclusion. This system of intensities and complications culminates in an understanding of the eternal return as a Dionysian affirmation of divergent simulacra, where nonsense distributes sense.

The truth is that at the height to which hiday and I have soared, difference of sex is left behind.

<mark class="hltr-green">Everything has lost its sense, everything becomes simulacrum and vesti9e-even the object of work, the loved one, the world in itself or the self in the world ... ; that is, unless there be some sort of salvation for Robinson; unless he invents a new dimension or a third sense for the expression "loss of Others"; unless the absence of the Other and the dissolution of its structure do not simply disorganize the world but, on the contrary, open up a possibility of salvation. Robinson must return to the surface and discover surfaces. The pure surface is perhaps what Others were hiding from us. It is perhaps at the surface, like a mist, that an unknown image of things is detached and, from the earth, a new surface energy without possible others.</mark> [Page 327](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=327&annotation=TSHWW92G) 

<mark class="hltr-green">It is at the surface that doubles and ethereal Images first rise up; then the pure and free Elements arise in the celestial surveying of the field. The generalized erection is the erection of surfaces, their rectification-the disappearance of the Others. At the surface of the isle and the overarching sky, simulacra ascend and become phantasms. Doubles without resemblance and elements without constraint-these are the two aspects of the phantasm.</mark> [Page 327](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=327&page=328&annotation=DIG9D5QQ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">"Robinson turned the question over in his mind.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But hiday functions in an entirely different way-he indicates another, supposedly true world, an irreducible double which alone is genuine, and in this other world, a double of the Other who no longer is and cannot be. Not an Other, but something wholly other (un tout-autre) than the Other; not a replica, but a Double: one who reveals pure elements and dissolves objects, bodies, and the earth. "It seemed, indeed, that (Friday) belonged to an entirely different realm, wholly opposed to his master's order of earth and husbandry, on which he could have only a disruptive effect if anyone tried to imprison him within it." 24 It is for this reason that he is not even an object of desire for Robinson.</mark> [Page 329](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=329&annotation=JJVT9YDV) 
- [N] Friday represents a "wholly other" double that reveals elements and dissolves bodies/objects/earth. He is not an object of desire.
- [N] The Other is an a priori structure of the perceptual field (structure of the possible) that conditions the organization of objects, subjects, and desire.
- [N] The Other causes the temporal distinction between consciousness (past world/objects) and its object.
- [N] The absence or dissolution of the structure-Other (e.g., for Robinson on the desert isle) leads to a disorder of the world, a loss of transitions and virtuality.
- [N] However, the collapse of the Other reveals that the Other was the disturbance; its absence leads to a "straightening out" and "generalized erection" (of surfaces, elements).
- [N] The Other imprisons elements within bodies/earth; its collapse liberates elements into pure, upright images/doubles.
- [N] Perversion is defined as a perverse structure (opposed to the structure-Other) that replaces the category of the possible with necessity and involves detaching desire from its object/body detour, linking it to Images/Elements ("conjunction of libido and elements").
- [N] Perversion is an "Other-cide," a murder of the possible, presupposed by the structure, not a behavior.
- [N] Tournier's novel shows the world *without* Others and implies this absence/dissolution leads to perversion (Robinson's deviation, the only possible Robinsonade).
- [N] Psychosis/neurosis are adventures of depth pacified by the structure-Other.
- [N] The "salvation" for Robinson is the discovery of the surface, the pure surface hidden by the Other, where simulacra become phantasms (doubles without resemblance, elements without constraint).

> This section analyzes Tournier's *Friday* as a novel exploring the "world without Others." The Other is revealed as an a priori structure of the perceptual field that makes perception and desire possible by organizing elements into bodies, objects, and worlds. The absence or dissolution of this structure, depicted by Robinson's solitude, leads to a chaotic world but ultimately reveals a deeper truth: the Other was the source of disturbance and limitation. This absence enables the discovery of the *surface*, a new dimension where elements are liberated into pure images/phantasms (doubles without resemblance, elements without constraint), leading to a "rectification" of the world and desire that Deleuze interprets as the "perverse structure," a fundamental organization beyond conventional behavior, an "Other-cide" that replaces the possible with necessity.

### Thirty-Fifth Series of the Crack

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-Fifth Series of the Crack</mark> [Page 334](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=334&annotation=Z93R2B2Z) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">For example, if one says "I am ill," one is speaking, from the point of view of the neurotic, of a certain object in a certain situation, but one is also speaking of a process that is occurring in the interiority of the organism and in its physical depth-a rupture, a fissure, a wound which is not simply physical, but is also libidinal and destrudo-a crack.</mark> [Page 334](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=334&annotation=LMRG7F4A) 
- [N] Crack as physical (organism depth) and psychic (libidinal/destrudo) wound/rupture.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The entire drama of illness unfolds between "I am ill" and "one dies." It unfolds between the neurotic statement of the patient who has his object, his world, and his identity as a person, and the impersonal event of death which occurs on the threshold of the unconscious, at the limit of the subject, on the line of the Aion, in the pure form of the infinite past-future. The paradox of the event, as we have seen, is that it is an action or passion in the infinitve; it has a "voice" which is neither active nor passive, but which, on the contrary, is the source of both the active and the passive as the result of a transformation. The crack is a passion and an action.</mark> [Page 334](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=334&page=335&annotation=Q7C843T8) 
- [N] Illness is the drama between "I am ill" (neurotic, personal) and "one dies" (impersonal event, Aion).
- [N] The crack is a passion and an action in the infinitive, source of active/passive voice.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The formula "one dies" is the form of the event, the form of the infinitive, which expresses an eternal truth and which possesses an infinite value (being related to the time of the Aion, the indefinite past and future), while the formula "I am ill" is only the actualization of the event, its incorporation into a state of affairs, a spatio-temporal event, which has only a finite value (being related to the time of Chronos, the always limited present). And it is this difference which is essential. It is this difference which causes the event to be that which exceeds its actualization.</mark> [Page 335](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=335&annotation=7E3S6Q27) 
- [N] "One dies" = event/infinitive/Aion/eternal truth/infinite value; "I am ill" = actualization/Chronos/finite value.
- [N] The difference between event and actualization is essential; event exceeds actualization.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The crack is not only a point in the body's depth, it is also a line or a surface on the limit of the body, where the infinite past-future is at last determined, where the ideal accident (event) is finally inscribed, and where the body, ceasing to be anything but a body in depth, becomes a body without organs.</mark> [Page 335](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=335&annotation=537G463B) 
- [N] The crack is also a surface/line on the body's limit (not just depth), where Aion is determined and the body becomes body without organs.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The two are indissociable; it is impossible to determine whether the crack is first of all corporeal (depth) and secondarily ideational (surface), or vice versa. It is, in any case, simultaneously depth and surface, and it does not allow itself to be reduced to one of the two dimensions.</mark> [Page 335](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=335&annotation=72M3H8C2) 
- [N] The crack is simultaneously depth and surface, irreducible to one dimension.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What is essential is not only that the crack should be physical as well as psychic, but that it should be understood precisely as the limit, the surface, the "between" where the physical communicates with the psychical, and also where language communicates with things.</mark> [Page 335](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=335&page=336&annotation=QY82729Z) 
- [N] The crack is the limit/surface/between where physical/psychic and language/things communicate.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">J9R3YV8G</mark> [Page 336](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=336&annotation=J9R3YV8G) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For what is essential in the illness is the crack or fault, this incorporeal event on the surface that constitutes the very limit of life and death, where the body itself opens onto the pure past and the pure future.</mark> [Page 336](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=336&annotation=9QMW8WRI) 
- [N] The crack (incorporeal event on surface) is the limit of life/death where body opens to pure past/future (Aion).

<mark class="hltr-green">It is this crack, then, which causes the body to cease being a single unity, to open up in depth and at the surface, to cease being anything but depth, and to become, in an act of counter-actualization, the unlimited past-future in the indefinite form of a verb. It is the instantaneous and pure time of the crack that causes the body to cease being limited and defined by its present, its acts and passions, and its qualities and properties. It is the ideal time of the crack that allows us to grasp the pure event in its eternal truth. It is here that the transmutation occurs. This transmutation does not at all reside in a miraculous metamorphosis, nor in a sudden mystical illumination. It is no more than this: a conversion of the action into passion and the passion into action, insofar as the crack, like the verb, is both action and passion. It is the conversion of death into life and life into death, as the crack makes the body itself a body which does not cease to die, but also a body which does not finish living.</mark> [Page 336](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=336&page=337&annotation=38W67J9M) 
- [N] The crack enables counter-actualization, opening the body to Aion's infinite past-future (infinitive form of verb), converting action/passion and life/death.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Lacan is correct to show that the crack of the body is inseparable from the crack of language; the two cracks enter into resonance. The crack of language is the passage of language into the pure verb, the passage from speech to the infinitive, which gathers into one the entire divergence of series. It is the loss of the world and of the self, the loss of every object which would be denoted, every subject which would be manifested, and every concept which would be signified. The world and the self are lost in the unique event which concerns them all.</mark> [Page 337](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=337&annotation=R6H8S3A8) 
- [N] Crack of body inseparable from crack of language (resonance); language crack is passage to pure verb/infinitive, loss of world/self in unique event.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is the formula "one dies" or "one is ill," which in its impersonal or fourth person singular form says all the divergence of series and the communication of all events in a single one, at the surface.</mark> [Page 337](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=337&annotation=N3F4573D) 
- [N] "One dies" is the fourth person singular form, expressing divergence and communication of events at the surface.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When the crack of the body communicates with the crack of language, all of the disparate series, whether corporeal, psychic, or linguistic, resonate in the unique Event which hovers over them, without being actualized in any one of them in particular.</mark> [Page 337](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=337&page=337&annotation=C7L9F5Q5) 
- [N] Communication of body/language cracks causes resonance of disparate series in unique Event, not actualized in any particular one.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For the logic of sense is the logic of the eternal return of the event. In it, there is no longer anything but a pure distance between the infinite past-future of the event and the always limited present of its actualization. The logic of sense is the logic of this distance, which can never be bridged.</mark> [Page 337](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=337&page=338&annotation=9FMR355L) 
- [N] Logic of sense is logic of eternal return of event, the distance between Aion (event) and Chronos (actualization).

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To think is to reach this limit, to inscribe it in the body, and to extract from the crack, through transmutation, the eternal truth of the event.</mark> [Page 338](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=338&annotation=SY2H7J8W) 
- [N] Thinking is reaching the limit of the crack, inscribing it in the body, extracting the event's eternal truth through transmutation.

<mark class="hltr-green">In short, this entire book has the object of showing how the logic of sense makes the advent of an entirely new philosophy possible, a philosophy of the pure event as grasped in the pure time of the Aion and extracted from the spatio-temporal actualizations by the transmutation of the crack. In this philosophy, sense is grasped neither in things nor in the mind, but at the surface, as the incorporeal event or the ideal quasi-cause which is produced by the depth of bodies and actualized in them, but also as that which distributes itself over the metaphysical surface and actualizes bodies.</mark> [Page 338](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=338&page=338&annotation=5K43Y9QL) 
- [N] Logic of sense enables philosophy of pure event (Aion, transmutation via crack), where sense is at surface, incorporeal quasi-cause, produced by/actualized in bodies, distributes itself over metaphysical surface.

> This section explores the "crack" as a fundamental concept linking physical depth and linguistic/metaphysical surface. The crack is simultaneously a wound in the body's depth, an incorporeal event on the surface, and the limit where physical, psychic, language, and things communicate. It enables the transmutation of action/passion and life/death and is inseparable from the crack of language (transition to the pure verb/infinitive). The logic of sense is the logic of this crack and the distance between the eternal event (Aion) and its limited actualization (Chronos), facilitating a new philosophy of the pure event grasped at the surface.

### Thirty-Sixth Series of Stones

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-Sixth Series of Stones</mark> [Page 339](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=339&annotation=8RMN8UHL) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Stones are neither body nor idea, but they are the elements of sense, pure logical attributes, or nonexisting entities. Stones cannot be thrown except on the condition that they already be there, in the unlimited future or the indefinite past. There is always a stone there where there has always been one. It is at the surface that the stone is thrown and makes sense. It is at the surface that the stone acquires its logic and its event. The logic of stones is neither physical nor psychical. It is incorporeal and impersonal; it is neither individual nor universal. But it is precisely because the stone has no existence other than that of subsistence, that it has no reality other than that of insistence, that it affects both the deepest bodies and the loftiest Ideas. It affects bodies as the weight which precipitates them or retains them, and Ideas as the obstacle which prevents them from being realized. It is the eternal truth of the stone which allows it to affect bodies and ideas in different ways in the eternal return of the same stone. "What is important," said Artaud, "is that stones fall as ideas, that ideas fall as stones."</mark> [Page 339](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=339&page=340&annotation=7U9U7QNM) 
- [N] Stones are elements of sense/logic/event, pure logical attributes/nonexisting entities (subsistence/insistence, not existence/reality).
- [N] Stones are thrown/make sense at the surface, where they acquire logic/event.
- [N] Stones affect bodies (weight) and ideas (obstacle) due to their eternal truth, returning in eternal return.
- [N] Stones are neither body nor idea, but incorporeal, impersonal, singular.

<mark class="hltr-green">In the logic of the stone, one can grasp the power of nonsense to distribute sense.</mark> [Page 340](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=340&annotation=99H3K6T2) 

<mark class="hltr-green">It is indeed in the logical and paradoxical eternity of the Aion that stones come back, with their eternal youth or their eternal age, and with their eternal truth. It is in the pure form of the unlimited past-future that the stone comes back again. There are here neither models nor copies, neither first time nor second time, neither original nor reproduction. There is only the eternal return of the simulacrum which includes simulacrum and simulated at once, as in the case of the stone thrown which includes the stone which is there before it is thrown and the stone which is there after it has been thrown.</mark> [Page 340](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=340&annotation=B6T6F9IL) 
- [N] Stones return in the Aion (eternal truth), eternal return of the simulacrum (includes simulated), no models/copies/original/reproduction.

<mark class="hltr-green">It is when one is at the surface, exposed to the pure event of the stone, that one is able at last to go into the depths and to rise up to the ideas, but without confusing stones with depths, nor logic with the heights.</mark> [Page 340](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=340&page=341&annotation=J7V65M5G) 
- [N] Being at the surface allows one to access depths/ideas without confusing them with the stone/logic.

<mark class="hltr-green">To grasp the stone as sense is to raise the simulacrum to the height of the idea, and to discover the pure event as the transcendental ideality of stone, as opposed to the Idea understood as essence. It is to go from the formless to the pure unformed. What can physics do but make the stone fall in the air? And what can psychics do but cause it to penetrate a body or rebound on it? But the logic of the stone is to make the stone fall as an idea, and to give to ideas the materiality of stones. It is here that transmutation occurs.</mark> [Page 341](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=341&annotation=Q5T4V4M2) 
- [N] Grasping stone as sense = raising simulacrum to idea, discovering event as transcendental ideality, transmutation.

> The thirty-sixth series uses the "stone" as an example of an element of sense, a pure logical attribute existing at the surface with subsistence and insistence, not material existence or conceptual reality. Stones are thrown/make sense at the surface, affecting bodies (as weight) and ideas (as obstacle) due to their eternal truth, returning in the Aion as simulacra. The logic of the stone is the power of nonsense to distribute sense and represents a transmutation that raises the simulacrum to the level of ideal event, allowing access to depths and ideas without reducing one to the other.

### Thirty-Seventh Series of Simple Bodies

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-Seventh Series of Simple Bodies</mark> [Page 342](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=342&annotation=Y8R6A4W6) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A simple body, fire, air, earth, or water, exists in a certain way, and acts and suffers in a certain way, but it is only capable of receiving sense from its relation to an unlimited past-future which is not identical with its own present. The simple body is opposed to the mixed body as much as the mixed body is opposed to the simple body. Simple bodies are always there, in all their aspects: they are "always already" there, but also "yet to come," without ever being in the present.</mark> [Page 342](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=342&annotation=TWH99P4B)

<mark class="hltr-green">We have seen that the event is the attribute in the infinitive. It is action and passion, detached from bodies. It is the distinction of the "expressed" from the proposition and the "attribute" from the state of affairs. It is subsistent and insistent, but not existent or real. It is extra-Being, the minimum of Being common to the real, the possible, and the impossible. It is neutral, impassive, and sterile. It is a double, a simulacrum, or an idol. It is the site of the eternal return. It is the accident separated from its actualization, the pure event which is always already passed and yet to come. It is the limit, the frontier, the surface, the crack, the between.</mark> [Page 343](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=343&page=344&annotation=B7Q8S5G8)

- [N] Simple body world is paradoxical, without mixture, Other, or present-attached time.

<mark class="hltr-green">The world of simple bodies is a world without Others, a world without the possible, a world without Chronos-a world of pure events, of the eternal return, of nomadic distributions, of crowned anarchies, of the indefinite past-future, of the pure infinitive, of the simulacrum, of the crack, and of the pure surface. This is the world that is affirmed in this book.</mark> [Page 345](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=345&page=345&annotation=S4Q9H7P2) 
- [N] Simple body world is world of pure events, eternal return, nomadic distributions, crowned anarchies, Aion, infinitive, simulacrum, crack, pure surface.

> The thirty-seventh series defines "simple bodies" not as physical bodies but as actions, passions, qualities, or attributes in the infinitive form, detached from bodies and grasped in their eternal truth (pure events). These are paradoxes, existing in the Aion (always/yet to come), without relation to the Other or the possible. The world of simple bodies is the world of pure events, the eternal return, simulacra, the crack, and the pure surface â€“ the world affirmed throughout the book, distinct from the world of mixed/composite bodies that generate problems.

### Thirty-Eighth Series of Sense and Event

<mark class="hltr-purple">Thirty-Eighth Series of Sense and Event</mark> [Page 346](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=346&annotation=337H29XW) 

<mark class="hltr-green">Sense and event are the same thing, but their identity is that of the expressed of the proposition and the attribute of the state of affairs. The identity of the expressed and the attribute defines the ideality or the incorporeal status of sense and event. This identity is maintained and renewed at the surface, as the surface twists that which expresses it into that which is expressed. The surface makes the entire proposition reflect the state of affairs in such a way that the expressed of the proposition merges with the attribute of the state of affairs, and that language becomes possible in this operation. Sense is therefore precisely at the frontier which allows language to be related to things. This is the operation by means of which the sense of that which is said is said of that concerning which it is said.</mark> [Page 346](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=346&page=346&annotation=QXTQ322J) 
- [N] Sense and event are the same thing (expressed of proposition, attribute of state of affairs), their identity is their ideality/incorporeal status.
- [N] This identity is maintained at the surface, where proposition reflects state of affairs and language relates to things.
- [N] The operation is: sense of what is said is said *of* that concerning which it is said.

<mark class="hltr-green">This operation is always expressed by the pure infinitive.</mark> [Page 346](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=346&annotation=NTW82B4S) 

<mark class="hltr-green">sense is produced at the surface by the deepest states of affairs, by the action and passion of bodies in their depths. It is this production that makes language possible.</mark> [Page 346](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=346&page=347&annotation=D47TQL5L) 
- [N] Sense is produced at the surface by deep bodily states/actions/passions; this production makes language possible.

<mark class="hltr-green">It would be possible to say that sense has no sense, but is opposed to the absence of sense. It gives sense, but only in disjoining it from itself. In fact, sense is a double of itself. It is at once what is said of things and what exists in the proposition; it is both at once, but neither one without the other, always on the two sides of the frontier that it constitutes. This double is neither model nor copy, neither original nor reproduction; it is a simulacrum. This double does not resemble that which is expressed any more than it resembles the expression; it is only coextensive with both.</mark> [Page 347](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=347&annotation=6A5H88IL) 
- [N] Sense has no sense itself but is opposed to absence of sense; it gives sense by disjoining it from itself.
- [N] Sense is a simulacrum (double), coextensive with what is said of things and what exists in the proposition, on both sides of the frontier.

<mark class="hltr-green">The problem is therefore to grasp language as that which relates itself to pure events, as that which is itself the unique event, and as that which is the pure univocal Verb of Being, the very Univocity of Being.</mark> [Page 347](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=347&annotation=W32J69M3) 

<mark class="hltr-green">The most difficult task is to understand the nature of this simulacrum-double-event-sense which is on the surface, without falling into the depths or flying off to the heights. It seems to us that this is the essential task of the philosophy of sense.</mark> [Page 347](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=347&page=347&annotation=S23C7YLL) 
- [N] The task of the philosophy of sense is to grasp the nature of the simulacrum-double-event-sense on the surface.

<mark class="hltr-green">To grasp sense and event in their ideality is to grasp them in their eternal truth, distinct from their actualizations. It is to grasp them as something yet to come and always already passed. It is to extract them from the limited time of Chronos and to locate them in the unlimited time of the Aion. It is to grasp them in their ideality, which is not at all abstract but is rather a concrete, problematic, and transcendental ideality of singularities.</mark> [Page 347](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=347&page=348&annotation=T55W3B67) 
- [N] Grasping sense/event in their ideality (eternal truth) means grasping them in Aion, as concrete/problematic/transcendental singularities, not abstract.

<mark class="hltr-green">Thus, the entire philosophy of sense may be summarized as a Stoicism gone mad. Stoicism gave us the first principles of the logic of sense: the distinction between bodies and incorporeal events, the distinction between causes and quasi-causes, the distinction between the present and the eternal truth, the autonomy of the surface, the nature of the event as expressed of the proposition and as attribute of the state of affairs, the theory of the Aion and of instantaneous time. But Stoicism had also its restrictions: the absence of the concept of nonsense, the exclusive nature of the eternal truth of the event, the confusion of the quasi-cause with the infinite series of events themselves, the lack of the concept of the static genesis, and the absence of an ontology of the pure event understood as the Being of the incompossible. When these restrictions have been lifted by the contributions of Nietzsche (the eternal return, the will to power, the play of force, the affirmation of nonsense, the univocity of Being, the positive use of the disjunction), of Carroll (the structure of nonsense, the organization of surfaces, the simulacrum, the static genesis), and of psychoanalysis (the dynamic genesis, the phantasm, the crack, the transmutation)-this is when the logic of sense is truly unleashed.</mark> [Page 348](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=348&page=349&annotation=934N3X7E) 
- [N] Summary: Philosophy of sense = Stoicism gone mad, combining Stoic principles with Nietzsche (eternal return, nonsense, univocity, affirmation), Carroll (nonsense structure, surfaces, simulacrum, static genesis), and psychoanalysis (dynamic genesis, phantasm, crack, transmutation).

<mark class="hltr-green">In short, the expressed is the sense of that which is said. This is the ultimate unity of language and the Being which is said of language.</mark> [Page 349](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4SXZCGV?page=349&annotation=P9X43XNY) 
- [N] Expressed = sense of what is said = ultimate unity of language and Being said of language.

> The thirty-eighth series concludes the book by reiterating the core identity of sense and event as the incorporeal expressed/attribute located at the surface, enabling language's relation to things. Sense, distinct from absence, is a productive double, a simulacrum. The philosophy of sense aims to grasp this surface entity in its eternal, problematic, transcendental ideality (in Aion). The logic of sense, the logic of the pure event, is a "Stoicism gone mad," integrating contributions from Nietzsche, Carroll, and psychoanalysis to affirm the univocity of Being and language on the surface.
