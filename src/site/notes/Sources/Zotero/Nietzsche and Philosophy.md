### Foreword

<mark class="hltr-purple">Foreword</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=10&annotation=A4C4TKTA)

### Key Concepts: Multiplicity, Becoming, Affirmation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The three most important concepts in this book are multiplicity, becoming, and affirmation</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=10&annotation=DRAZPW59)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In Nietzsche's concept of multiplicity Deleuze finds a notion of difference that does not refer back to (and thus depend on) a primary identity, a difference that can never be corralled into an ultimate unity. Multiplicity is precisely this expanding, proliferating set of differences that stand on their own, autonomous. At the most basic level, one can recognize Nietzsche's profound betrayal of the primacy of identity and unity in his famous pronouncement that God is dead: there is no identity from which all the differences of the world emanate, nor any unity to which they fall back. Instead of any divine ordering principles Nietzsche proposes the will to power as a perpetual motor that proÂ­duces differences. What the will wills is difference. The will to power is a machine of multiplicities.</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=10&annotation=7KT27JR4)
- [N] Multiplicity. "What the will wills is difference. The will to power is a machine of multiplicities."

<mark class="hltr-yellow">They place the emphasis on becoming to highlight the fact that being itself is an act of creÂ­ation, and that creation can only be understood as the production of differences, of multiplicities.</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=10&annotation=3UAVTA3G)
- [N] Emphasis on becoming rather than being

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is a mistake to understand the eternal return as simÂ­ply a repetition of the past, a return of the same. Nietzsche's notion, Deleuze explains, points in the opposite direction: "It is not being that returns, but rather the returning itself that constitutes being insofar as it is affirmed of becoming and of that which passes. It is not some one thing which returns but rather returning itself is the one thing which is affirmed of diversity or multiplicity" (48) . What Deleuze is working to develop, once again, is an autonomous conception of difference and its constant proliferation in a creative process of becoming.</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=11&annotation=TI6RWTEX)
- [N] Affirming the creative process of becoming

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze finds an ethics and even a politics of multiplicity and becoming in Nietzsche's notion of affirmation. He begins with Nietzsche's typology of active and reactive forces. Active forces, like becoming itself, are deemed superior because they are creative: they produce differences, whereas reactive forces produce nothing. ReacÂ­ tive forces only lead to ressentiment and bad conscience. Nietzsche poses this as an ethical guide and a principle of selection: always seek out the active forces in life and avoid the reactive ones. The typology of active and reactive is then extended in Nietzsche's distinction beÂ­ tween affirmation and negation. Deleuze explains this distinction, for example, in the contrast between master and slave mentalities. Both, of course, involve affirmation and negation. The contrast dramatized in these two Nietzschean categories, however, lies in the priority and order given to affirmation and negation in each. The slave mentality says, "You are evil, therefore I am good," whereas the master mentality says, "I am good, therefore you are evil." The slave mentality, Deleuze explains, is purely reactive. It needs to pass through two negations to arrive at an affirmation: since you are evil and I am not you, thereÂ­fore I am good. The master mentality, in contrast, is purely active. Its affirmation of itself is autonomous and the negation of the other merely secondary. This affirmation, I should emphasize, has nothing to do with acceptance of or acquiescence to how things are, what is, but rather purely an act of creation. This is indeed how Deleuze reads the eternal return as an ethical principle of selection oriented toward the future: "whatever you will, will it in such a way that you also will its eternal return" (68). To complete the ethical proposition, then, Deleuze links affirmative practices and their acts of creation to a life of joy, which stands opposed to all the reactive forces and sad passions.</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=11&annotation=TT9TC758)
- [N] Affirmation, joy, creation, active (becoming) vs. reactive (ressentiment) forces, master vs. slave

- [N] Multiplicity: difference not dependent on a primary identity; expanding set of autonomous differences. Will to Power produces differences.
- [N] Becoming: Being is an act of creation, production of differences/multiplicities.
- [N] Affirmation: Ethical principle of selection; seeking active forces over reactive ones. Master vs. Slave mentality contrast. Pure act of creation, not acceptance of what is. Linked to joy.

> This section introduces the three core concepts Deleuze identifies in Nietzsche's philosophy: multiplicity, becoming, and affirmation. Multiplicity refers to difference itself, autonomous and proliferating, driven by the will to power. Becoming highlights that existence is a creative process of producing differences. Affirmation is presented as an ethical principle of selecting active forces and creating, linked to joy, in contrast to reactive forces and ressentiment.

### Against the Dialectic

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Deleuze's primary charge against dialectical thinking is that, despite its claims, dialectics mystifies and destroys difference and is thus incapable of recognizing multiplicities. The dialectic pushes all differences to the extreme of contradiction so that it then can subsume them back into a unity. Real differences, according to Deleuze, are more subtle and nuanced than dialectical oppositions, and they do not rely on any negative founÂ­dation. On the basis of this proposition Deleuze can then contrast the double negations of dialectical thinking with Nietzsche's notion of affirmation.</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=12&annotation=YQP84LA2)
- [N] Against Hegel's dialectic

- [N] Dialectics destroys difference by pushing it to contradiction and subsuming it into unity.
- [N] Nietzschean differences are subtle and don't rely on negativity.

> Deleuze critiques dialectical thinking, arguing that it fails to grasp true difference by reducing it to contradiction and forcing it into unity, contrasting this with Nietzsche's concept of autonomous difference and affirmation.

### First Axis of Nietzsche's Philosophy: Force and Semeiology

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The first is concerned with force, with forces, and forms of general semeiology. Phenomena, things, organisms, societies, consciousness and spirits are signs, or rather symptoms, and themselves reflect states of forces.</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=17&annotation=7BT72UPZ)
- [N] First axis of Nietzsche's philosophy

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What is the mode of existence of the person who utters any given proposition, what mode of existence is needed in order to be able to utter it? The mode of existence is the state of forces insofar as it forms a type which can be expressed by signs or symptoms.</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=17&annotation=AIRHVBK9)
- [N] "Type" or mode of existence, state of forces

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Res sentiment and bad conscience are expressions of the triumph of reactive forces in man and even of the constitution of man by reactive forces: the man-slave . This shows the extent to which the Nietzschean notion of the slave does not necessarily stand for someone dominated, by fate or social condition, but also characterises the dominators as much as the dominated once the regime of domination comes under the sway of forces which are reactive and not active .</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=17&annotation=E2LCE72T)
- [N] Reactive concepts of ressentiment and bad conscience

- [N] The first axis concerns force and semeiology (study of signs/symptoms).
- [N] Phenomena are symptoms reflecting states of forces.
- [N] Mode of existence is a type formed by the state of forces.
- [N] Ressentiment and bad conscience express the triumph of reactive forces (the man-slave).

> Deleuze outlines the first major theme in Nietzsche's philosophy: force and semeiology. All phenomena are seen as symptoms of underlying forces, and the mode of existence of a person is determined by the type of forces at play. Ressentiment and bad conscience are presented as expressions of dominant reactive forces.

#on/nietzsche #on/force

### Second Axis: Will to Power and Ethics

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche is most misunderstood in relation to the question of power. Every time we interpret will to power as "wanting or seeking power" we encounter platitudes which have nothing to do with Nietzsche's thought. If it is true that all things reflect a state of forces then power designates the element, or rather the differential relationship, of forces which directly confront one another . This relationship expresses itself in the dynamic qualities of types such as "affirmation" and "negation" . Power is therefore not what the will wants, but on the contrary, the one that wants in the will. And "to want or seek power" is only the lowest degree of the will to power, its negative form, the guise it assumes when reactive forces prevail in the state of things.</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=18&annotation=SRSJFVUU)
- [N] The second axis of Nietzsche's philosophy, will to power, ethics. Power is not "what the will wants" but rather "the one that wants in the will"

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The one that ... does not refer to an individual, to a person, but rather to an event, that is, to the forces in their various relationships in a proposition or a phenomenon, and to the genetic relationship which determines these forces (power). "The one that" is always Dionysus, a mask or a guise of Dionysus, a flash of lightning.</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=18&annotation=9SW34LXJ)
- [N] "The one that..." refers to an event, the forces and their genetic relationship which determines these forces (power)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The eternal return is the strict opposite of this since it cannot be separated from a selection, from a double selection. Firstly, there is the selection of willing or of thought which constitutes Nietzscht's ethics: only will that of which one also wills the eternal return (to eliminate all half-willing, everything which can only be willed with the proviso "once, only once"). Secondly, there is the selection of being which constitutes Nietzsche's ontology: only that which becomes in the fullest sense of the word can return, is fit to return. Only action and affirmation return: becoming has being and only becoming has being. That which is opposed to becoming, the</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=18&annotation=9BH6G2S7)
- [N] [[Eternal Return\|Eternal Return]]

<mark class="hltr-yellow">same or the identical, strictly speaking, is not. The negative as the lowest degree of power, the reactive as the lowest degree af force, do not return because they are the opposite of becoming and only becoming has being. We can thus see how the eternal return is linked, not to a repetition of the same, but on the contrary, to a transmutaÂ­tion. It is the moment or the eternity of becoming which eliminates all that resists it . It releases, indeed it creates, the purely active and pure affirmation.</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=19&annotation=PT9B7HLU)
- [N] [[Eternal Return\|Eternal Return]] continued

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the Overman; he is the joint product of the will to power and the eternal return, Dionysus and Ariadne. This is why Nietzsche says that the will to power is not wanting, coveting or seeking power, but only "giving" or "creating" .</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=19&annotation=G2KSH649)
- [N] The "Overman", the product of will to power and eternal return (giving, creating)

- [N] Will to Power is not wanting power, but the differential relationship of forces; "the one that wants in the will".
- [N] "The one that" refers to events and the genetic relationship of forces, often symbolized by Dionysus.
- [N] Eternal Return is a double selection: willing only what you would will infinitely (ethics) and only what becomes returns (ontology).
- [N] Eternal Return is linked to transmutation and the creation of pure affirmation, not repetition of the identical.
- [N] The Overman is the product of the will to power and the eternal return, signifying creation and giving.

> The second axis explores the will to power and its ethical dimension, particularly through the concept of the eternal return. Will to power is defined as the differential relationship of forces, not the desire for dominance. The eternal return is presented as a principle of selection that affirms becoming and creates the active and affirmative, leading to the emergence of the Overman as a symbol of creation and giving.

### Debunking Misinterpretations

<mark class="hltr-yellow">As long as the reader persists in: 1) seeing the Nietzschean "slave" as someone who finds himself dominated by a master, and deserves to be; 2) understanding the will to power as a will which wants and seeks power; 3) conceiving the eternal return as the tedious return of the same; 4) imagining the Overman as a given master race - no positive relationship between Nietzsche and his reader will be possible . Nietzsche will appear a nihilist, or worse , a fascist and at best as an obscure and terrifying prophet.</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=19&annotation=QDQXKGLD)
- [N] Nietzsche is NOT a nihilist or fascist

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Overman is the focal point, where the reactive (ressentiment and bad conscience) is conquered, and where the negative gives way to affirmation.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=20&annotation=M8QXDIKX)
- [N] The "Overman"

- [N] Avoiding common misinterpretations of Nietzsche: slave as inherently subservient, will to power as desire for power, eternal return as repetition, Overman as master race.
- [N] Misinterpretation leads to seeing Nietzsche incorrectly (nihilist, fascist).
- [N] The Overman signifies the overcoming of reactive forces and the triumph of affirmation.

> Deleuze highlights common misreadings of Nietzsche's core concepts (slave, will to power, eternal return, Overman) that lead to inaccurate and negative portrayals, emphasizing that the Overman represents the overcoming of reactive forces and affirmation, not dominance or repetition.

### Nietzsche's Aphorisms and Thought-Movement

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A Nietzschean "aphorism" is not a mere fragment, a morsel of thought: it is a proposition which only makes sense in relation to the state of forces that it expresses, and which changes sense, which must change sense , according to the new forces which it is "capable" (has the power) of attracting.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=20&annotation=G7ELEEYL)
- [N] Nietzsche's aphorisms changes sense according to new forces which it "has the power" of attracting

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche snatches thought from the element of truth and falsity. He turns it into an interpretation and an evaluation, interpretation of forces, evaluation of power . - It is a thoughtÂ­movement, not merely in the sense that Nietzsche wants to reconcile thought and concrete movement, but in the sense that thought itself must produce movements, bursts of extraordinary speed and slowÂ­ness (here again we can see the role of the aphorism, with its variable speeds and its "projectile-like" movement). As a result philosophy has a new relationship to the arts of movement: theatre, dance and music .</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=20&annotation=3SVTNIAQ)
- [N] The radical transformation of the image of thought that we create for ourselves

- [N] Aphorisms are not fragments but propositions whose sense changes based on the forces they interact with.
- [N] Nietzschean thought is interpretation and evaluation of forces/power, moving beyond truth/falsity.
- [N] Thought itself is a movement, relating philosophy to arts of movement (theatre, dance, music).

> Nietzsche's aphorisms are dynamic expressions of forces, not static fragments. His philosophy transforms thought into an interpretive and evaluative process (of forces and power), conceiving of thought itself as a form of movement with affinities to arts like dance and music.

### To Think is To Create

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To think is to create: this is Nietzsche's greatest lesson. To think, to cast the dice ... : this was already the sense of the eternal return.</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=21&annotation=ET94Y4RX)
- [N] TO THINK IS TO CREATE

- [N] The core Nietzschean lesson is that thinking is creation.
- [N] The act of thinking is linked to the creative act symbolized by casting the dice (eternal return).

> Nietzsche's fundamental teaching is that thinking is synonymous with creation, linking the philosophical act to the generative process inherent in the eternal return.

### Genealogy: The Value of Origin and the Origin of Values

<mark class="hltr-purple">1. The Concept of Genealogy</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=24&annotation=GY79MAUQ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is the crucial point; high and low , noble and base , are not values but represent the differential element from which the value of values themselves derives.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=25&annotation=NYRGZKIW)
- [N] Evaluation is a differential element of corresponding values

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche creates the new concept of genealogy. The philosopher is a genealogist rather than a Kantian tribunal judge or a utilitarian mechanic .</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=25&annotation=8CLEGJB9)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Genealogy means both the value of origin and the origin of values. Genealogy is as opposed to absolute values as it is to relative or utilitarian ones. Genealogy signifies the differential element of values from which their value itself derives. Genealogy thus means origin or birth, but also difference or distance in the origin. Genealogy means nobility and baseness, nobility and vulgarity, nobility and decadence in the origin. The noble and the vulgar, the high and the low - this is the truly genealogical and critical element.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=25&annotation=UTWYJVGZ)
- [N] Genealogy, the value of origin and the origin of values

- [N] Genealogy is a new philosophical concept, opposing absolute/relative/utilitarian values.
- [N] Genealogy studies both the *value* of origin and the *origin* of values.
- [N] It signifies the differential element (high/low, noble/base) from which value derives.

> Genealogy, as a key Nietzschean concept, investigates both the inherent worth found in the origin of values and the historical emergence of values themselves. It focuses on the differential element (noble/base) rather than absolute or relative judgments.

#on/genealogy #on/values

### Critique as Active Creation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">critique is also at its most positive . The differential element is both a critique of the value of values and the positive element of a creation.</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=25&annotation=YXY8TC2A)
- [N] Critique is active, not reactive

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being, the divine wickedÂ­ness without which perfection could not be imagined (EH I 6-7). This way of being is that of the philosopher precisely because he intends to wield the differential element as critic and creator and therefore as a hammer.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=26&annotation=AXCS9X2L)
- [N] The way of the philosopher is that of Wielding the differential element as a critic and creator and therefore as a hammer

- [N] Critique is a positive, active force, not a reactive one rooted in ressentiment.
- [N] The philosopher, as critic and creator wielding the differential element, uses critique as a hammer.

> Nietzschean critique is an active, positive force of creation and evaluation, stemming from an active mode of existence rather than reactive ressentiment. The philosopher uses this critical-creative capacity like a hammer to evaluate values.

### Sense: Interpretation of Forces

<mark class="hltr-purple">2. Sense</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=26&annotation=7I3PU4SN)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We will never fmd the sense of something (of a human, a biological or even a physical phenomenon) if we do not know the force3* which appropriates the thing, which exploits it, which takes possession of it or is expressed in it. A phenomenon is not an appearance or even an apparition but a sign, a symptom which finds its meaning in an existing force.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=26&annotation=HE9JNA4W)
- [N] We must find the force that exploits the thing. The thing is a sign, a symptom which finds its meaning in a force.
Philosophy and sciences are symptomatol and semeiological

<mark class="hltr-yellow">All force is appropriation, domination, exploitation of a quantity of reality. Even perception, in its divers aspects, is the expression of forces which appropriate nature. That is to say that nature itself has a history . The history of a thing, in general, is the succession of forces which take possession of it and the co-existence of the forces which struggle for possession.</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=26&annotation=D588Z6J2)
- [N] The history of a thing is the succession of forces which take possession of it and the coexistence of forces which struggle for possession.
Sense is a constellation of successions and also coexistences, making interpretation an art.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Gods are dead but they have died from laughing, on hearing one God claim to be the only one, "Is not precisely this godliness, that there are gods but no God?" (Z III 'Of the Apostates" , p. 201). And the death of this God, who claimed to be the only one, is itself plural; the death of God is an event with a multiple sense</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=27&annotation=AWB8WSIW)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is no event, no phenomenon, word or thought which does not have a multiple sense . A thing is sometimes this, sometimes that, sometimes something more compliÂ­ cated - depending on the forces (the gods) which take possession of it.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=27&annotation=L5UFK56Z)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The pluralist idea that a thing has many senses, the idea that there are many things and one thing can be seen as "this and then that" is philosophy's greatest achievement, the conquest of the true concept, its maturity and not its renunciation or infancy.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=27&annotation=MDNUPHP6)
- [N] "This and then that" not "this, that, here, now"
The art of philosophy, weighing, interpretation, estimation of the forces and its relation with others at every instant

- [N] The sense of anything is found by understanding the force that appropriates it; phenomena are symptoms of forces.
- [N] Force is appropriation/domination; the history of a thing is the succession/coexistence of forces possessing it.
- [N] Events/phenomena have multiple senses depending on the forces that take possession of them.
- [N] Recognizing the multiple sense of things ("this and then that") is a key philosophical achievement.

> To grasp the "sense" of phenomena, one must identify the forces that appropriate and exploit them. Everything is a symptom of force, and the history of things is a history of forces taking possession. This leads to a pluralistic understanding where things have multiple senses depending on the dominant forces.

### Life Imitates Matter

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To begin with life must imitate matter merely in order to survive. A force would not survive if it did not first of all borrow the feature of the forces with which it struggles (GM III 8, 9, 10)</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=28&annotation=RC64SC2X)

- [N] Life initially imitates matter for survival, borrowing features from opposing forces.

> For survival, life must initially mimic the qualities of the material forces it contends with.

### The Far-Sighted Eye

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The difference in the origin does not appear at the origin - except perhaps to a particularly practised eye, the eye which sees from afar, the eye of the far-sighted, the eye of the genealogist</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=28&annotation=WJH6232Y)

- [N] The fundamental difference in origin is only discernible to the keen, far-sighted eye of the genealogist.

> True differences at the origin of things are not immediately apparent; they require the perceptive, far-sighted gaze of the genealogist.

- [N] ?? - This note seems to be asking for clarification. The quote emphasizes that only the higher degrees or intensities of forces/qualities are significant.

- [N] Only the higher degrees (intensities, qualities) of things are ultimately significant.

- [N] ... relation, difference in and according to the essence.
Against atomism, Marx says atoms can only relate to themselves, but then how can the atom be affirmed if it has nothing to relate to?

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche's concept of force is therefore that of a force which is related to another force: in this form force is called will. The will (will to power) is the differential element of force</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=30&annotation=3XJVZLYR)
- [N] Will to power = the differential element of force

<mark class="hltr-yellow">" 'Will' can of course operate only on 'will' - and not on 'matter' (not on 'nerves' for example): enough, one must venture the hypothesis that wherever 'effects' are recognised, will is operating on will" (BGE 36 p. 49).</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=30&annotation=D6BQZV5W)

- [N] Pluralism

- [N] Everything is possessed by force, and forces are always related to other forces.
- [N] Nietzsche's philosophy of nature is based on a plurality of forces in relations of tension and distance.
- [N] Unlike atomism, Nietzschean force (will) is inherently relational and contains difference within its essence.
- [N] Will (will to power) is defined as the differential element of force.
- [N] Will only operates on will.
- [N] Nietzsche's divergence from Schopenhauer centers on whether the will is unitary or multiple (Nietzsche affirms multiplicity).

> Nietzsche's philosophy of the will posits that everything is an expression of forces, and forces are always related to other forces. The will to power is not a substance but the differential element *within* force that determines its relation to others. Will only acts upon will, and Nietzsche's view emphasizes the multiplicity of will, contrasting with Schopenhauer's unitary concept.

### Affirmation of Difference vs. Dialectical Negation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In Nietzsche the essential relation of one force to another is never conceived of as a negative element in the essence . In its relation with the other the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the othe</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=31&annotation=EHZY37ZX)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">or that which it is not, it affirms its own difference and enjoys this difference. The negative is not present in the essence as that from which force draws its activity: on the contrary it is a result of activity, of the existence of an active force and the affirmation of its difference .</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=32&annotation=HJS2VE7M)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For the speculative element of negation, opposition or contradiction Nietzsche substitutes the practical element of differÂ­ence , the object of affirmation and enjoyment.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=32&annotation=3PDWPHYE)
- [N] Difference, not negation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What a will wants is to affirm its difference . In its essential relation with the "other" a will makes its difference an object of affirmation. "The pleasure of knowing oneself different", the enjoyment of difference (BGE 260)</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=32&annotation=2DJJ32EE)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche's "yes" is opposed to the dialectical "no"; affirÂ­mation to dialectical negation; difference to dialectical contradiction; joy, enjoyment, to dialectical labour; lightness, dance, to dialectical responsibilities. The empirical feeling of difference, in short hierarÂ­chy, is the essential motor of the concept, deeper and more effective than all thought about contradiction.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=32&annotation=S6YV2KW9)
- [N] YES not NO

- [N] The relation of forces in Nietzsche is based on affirmation of difference, not negation.
- [N] Negation is a *result* of active force and affirmation of difference, not a foundational element.
- [N] Nietzsche replaces dialectical negation/contradiction with the practical element of difference, affirmation, and enjoyment.
- [N] Will affirms its own difference and finds enjoyment in it.
- [N] Nietzsche's affirmation ("yes") opposes dialectical negation ("no"). Difference/joy/lightness oppose contradiction/labor/responsibility.

> Unlike dialectics which relies on negation and contradiction, Nietzsche's philosophy of forces is centered on the active affirmation and enjoyment of difference. Negation is merely a consequence of this primary affirmation, and Nietzsche's fundamental stance is one of "yes" to difference, joy, and lightness, in contrast to the dialectical emphasis on negativity.

### Misunderstanding Will and Power: Hegel vs. Nietzsche

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The famous dialectical aspect of the masterÂ­slave relationship depends on the fact that power is conceived not as will to power but as representation of power, representation of superiority, recognition by "the one" of the superiority of "the other" . What the wills in Hegel want is to have their power recognised, to represent their power.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=33&annotation=T6KMLF4C)
- [N] Hegels wills want to have their power recognized, to represent their power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The slave only conceives of power as the object of a recognition, the content of a representation, the stake in a competition, and therefore makes it depend, at the end of a fight, on a simple attribution of established values.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=33&annotation=3MKP9VTU)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Underneath the Hegelian image of the master we always fmd the slave.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=33&annotation=NBXM8P5T)

- [N] Hegelian master-slave dialectic misunderstands power as representation/recognition of established values.
- [N] Hegelian wills seek recognition of their power.
- [N] The slave mentality views power solely through the lens of recognition and competition based on existing values.
- [N] The Hegelian master figure is ultimately rooted in the slave's perspective.

> Deleuze argues that the Hegelian master-slave dialectic operates based on a misunderstanding of power, viewing it as representation and the desire for recognition of pre-established values â€“ a perspective inherently limited by the slave mentality.

### The Problem of Tragedy

<mark class="hltr-purple">5. The Problem of Tragedy</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=33&annotation=77CX364E)

### Dialectical vs. Nietzschean Tragedy

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The dialectic proposes a certain conception of the tragic : linking it to the negative, to opposition and to contradiction. The contradiction of suffering and life, of fmite and infinite in life itself, of particular destiny and universal spirit in the idea, the movement of contradiction and its resolution - this is how tragedy is represented.</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=34&annotation=3E52L5KL)
- [N] Tragedy of the dialectic is linked to the negative, contradiction, opposition

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Dionysus and Apollo are therefore not opposed as the terms of a contradiction but rather as two antitheÂ­tical ways of resolving it; Apollo mediately, in the contemplation of the plastic image, Dionysus immediately in the reproduction, in the musical symbol of the will. 7 Dionysus is like the background on which Apollo _embroiders beautiful appearances; but beneath Apollo Dionysus rumbles. The antithesis of the two must therefore be resolÂ­ved, "transformed into a unity" . 8</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=35&annotation=QXJCSN5H)
- [N] Birth of Tragedy

- [N] The dialectic links tragedy to negativity, opposition, and contradiction (e.g., life vs. suffering).
- [N] Apollo and Dionysus are presented not as contradictory forces but as different ways of resolving antithesis (mediation vs. immediate reproduction).

> While dialectics views tragedy through the lens of negation and contradiction, Nietzsche's conception, particularly in *Birth of Tragedy* (via Apollo and Dionysus), understands it through antithetical resolutions and affirmations rather than fundamental negativity.

### Dionysus: The Affirmative God

<mark class="hltr-yellow">From ï¿½he outset Dionysus is insistently presented as the affirmative and affirming god. He is not content with "resolving" pain in a higher and supra personal pleasure but rather he affirms it and turns it into someone's pleasure . This is why Dionysus is himself transformed in multiple affirmations, rather than being dissolved in original being or reabsorbing multiplicity into primeval depths. He affirms the pains of growth rather than reproducing the sufferings of individuation . He is the god who affirms life, for whom life must be affirmed, but not justified or redeemed.</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=36&annotation=CS5RTT8K)
- [N] Dionysus,

- [N] Dionysus is consistently portrayed as an affirmative god who affirms and transforms pain into pleasure.
- [N] He embodies multiple affirmations, not a dissolution into unity.
- [N] Dionysus affirms life itself, without needing justification or redemption.

> Dionysus represents pure affirmation, not only accepting pain but transforming it into pleasure and embodying a multiplicity of affirmations. He is the god who unconditionally affirms life, contrasting with philosophies that seek to justify or redeem suffering.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">terms of the idea, he posits life as something which should be judged, justified and redeemed by the idea. He asks us to feel that life, crushed by the weight of the negative, is unworthy of being desired for itself, experienced in itself. Socrates is "the theoretical man" , the only true opposite of the tragic man (BT 1 5).</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=37&annotation=QGDTFUMT)
- [N] Socrates opposes the idea to life.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It will therefore be necessary for the tragic man, at the same time as he discovers his own element in pure affirmation, to discover his deepest enemy as the one who carries out the enterprise of negation in a true, defmitive and essential manner</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=37&annotation=VS9H3UZ2)

- [N] Socrates is seen as a figure of decadence who opposes the ideal realm to life.
- [N] Socrates judges life based on ideals, suggesting it needs justification or redemption.
- [N] The tragic man finds his element in pure affirmation and recognizes the one who embodies negation (like Socrates) as his enemy.

> Socrates, as the "theoretical man," is characterized as an enemy of the tragic man by opposing abstract ideals to life and judging life as something needing justification, embodying a fundamental enterprise of negation.

### Christianity, Suffering, and Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For Christianity the fact of suffering in life means primarily that life is not just, that it is even essentially unjust, that it pays for an essential injustice by suffering, it is blameworthy because it suffers.</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=38&annotation=DJS99WD4)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">These two aspects of Christianity form what Nietzsche calls "bad conscience" or the interÂ­nalisation of pain (GM II). They define truly Christian nihilism, that is to say the way in which Christianity denies life; on the one side the machine for manufacturing guilt, the horrible pain-punishment equaÂ­tion, on the other side the machine to multiply pain, the justification by pain, the dark workshop.</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=38&annotation=5T8EZS5U5)
- [N] Christian nihilism

- [N] Christianity interprets suffering as proof of life's injustice and blameworthiness.
- [N] This leads to "bad conscience" (internalization of pain), which constitutes Christian nihilism.
- [N] Christianity functions as a machine for manufacturing guilt and multiplying pain, thus denying life.

> Christianity is critiqued for its interpretation of suffering as inherent injustice and blameworthiness, leading to the "bad conscience" and Christian nihilism which ultimately denies life itself through mechanisms of guilt and pain multiplication.

### Affirmation vs. Christian/Dialectical Negation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The opposition of Dionysus or Zarathustra to Christ is not a dialectical opposition, but opposition to the dialectic itself: differential affirmation against dialectical negaÂ­tion, against all nihilism and against this particular form of it.</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=40&annotation=S5D8S5U5)

- [N] The opposition between Dionysus/Zarathustra and Christ is not dialectical, but an opposition *against* the dialectic.
- [N] This is differential affirmation against dialectical negation and nihilism.

> The contrast between Dionysus/Zarathustra and Christ is framed as a fundamental opposition to the dialectic and nihilism, emphasizing differential affirmation over negation.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We must fmd, for each thing in tum, the special means by which it is affirmed, by which it ceases to be negative.12 The tragic is not to be found in this anguish or disgust, nor in a nostalgia for lost unity. The tragic is only to be found in multipÂ­licity, in the diversity of affirmation as such . What defmes the tragic is the joy of multiplicity, plural joy. This joy is not the result of a sublimation, a purging, a compensation, a resignation or a reconciliaÂ­tion.</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=40&annotation=QHIJ3L8R)

- [N] The tragic not founded on the relation of life and the negative

- [N] The tragic is found in the diversity of affirmation and the joy of multiplicity, not in anguish or longing for unity.
- [N] The tragic is the aesthetic form of joy.
- [N] The tragic is based on the relation of joy and multiplicity, not life and the negative.

> Contrary to interpretations linking it to suffering or the negative, the tragic, for Nietzsche, is fundamentally defined by multiple and pluralist affirmation and the joy found in multiplicity. It is an aesthetic concept of joy, not a moral solution to pain.

### Suffering, Guilt, and Irresponsibility

<mark class="hltr-yellow">suffering was used as a way of proving the injustice of existence, but at the same time as a way of finding a higher and divine justification for it.

- [N] Suffering

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche does not see ressentiment (it's your fault) and bad conscience (it's my fault) and their common fruit (responsibility) as simple psychological events but rather as the fundamental categories of semitic and Christian thought, of our way of thinking and interpreting existence in general. Nietzsche takes on the tasks of providing a new ideal, a new interpretation and another way of thinking (GM II 23). "To give irresponsibility its positive sense ", "I wished to conquer the feeling of a full irresponsibility, to make myself independent of praise and blame , of present and past" (VP III 383, 465). Irresponsibility - Nietzsche's most noble and beautiful secret.</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=44&annotation=D3359D3F)

- [N] Suffering has been used to prove life's injustice and justify it divinely.
- [N] Ressentiment, bad conscience, and responsibility are fundamental categories of Semitic/Christian thought, not just psychological states.
- [N] Nietzsche seeks a new interpretation emphasizing "irresponsibility" in a positive sense, transcending blame and responsibility.

> Suffering is often used to condemn life and then justify it divinely through atonement. Nietzsche challenges this perspective, viewing ressentiment, bad conscience, and responsibility as pervasive categories of thought rooted in reactive resentment, and proposes a positive sense of "irresponsibility" that liberates from blame and guilt.

- [N] Existence is innocent

- [N] The core question shifts from responsibility to the innocence of existence.
- [N] Dionysus reveals the truth of innocence, inherent in plurality and becoming.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Every thing is referred to a force capable of interpreting it; every force is referred to what it is able to do, from which it is inseparable .

- [N] The image of the sky as a dance floor for divine chances and a table for dice symbolizes the affirmation of chance.
- [N] The dicethrow represents the affirmation of chance (the throw) and necessity (the outcome).
- [N] Things prefer to "dance on the feet of chance."

> The dicethrow symbolizes the affirmation of both chance (the act of throwing) and necessity (the resulting combination), suggesting a universe that embraces the unpredictable dance of possibilities.

### Affirming Chance and Necessity

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There are many numbers with increasing or decreasing probabilities, but only one number of chance as such, one fatal number which reunites all the fragments of chance, like midday gathers together the scattered parts of midnight. This is why it is sufficient for the player to affirm chance once in order to produce the number which brings back the diceÂ­throw.</mark> [Page 49](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=49&annotation=KJN8ZFQR)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To abolish chance by holding it in the grip of causality and finality, to count on the repetition of throws rather than affirming chance, to anticipate a result instead of affirming necessity - these are all the operations of a bad player.</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=50&annotation=XGLJGB27)
- [N] To know how to affirm chance is to know how to play

<mark class="hltr-yellow">That the universe has no purpose, that it has no end to hope for any more than it has causes to be known - this is the certainty necessary to play well (VP III 465).</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=50&annotation=B8RNKCHZ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Not a probability distributed over several throws but all chance at once; not a final, desired, willed combination, but the fatal combination, fatal and loved, amor fati; not the return of a combination by the number of throws, but the repetition of a dicethrow by the nature of the fatally obtained number.</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=50&annotation=HVPH7PTJ)
- [N] Chance-necessity or chance-destiny, amor fati (fatal and loved)

- [N] Affirming chance involves embracing the "fatal number" that unites fragments of chance, producing the return of the dicethrow.
- [N] A "bad player" tries to eliminate chance through causality/finality or relies on repetition/anticipation instead of affirming chance/necessity.
- [N] Playing well requires the certainty that the universe is purposeless and without predetermined causes/ends.
- [N] True affirmation of chance is embracing "all chance at once" and loving the "fatal combination" (amor fati), leading to the repetition of the *dicethrow* itself.

> Playing well the "game" of existence requires the affirmation of both chance and necessity, embracing the unpredictable throw and its fated outcome (amor fati), rejecting attempts to control or eliminate chance through causality, finality, or statistical probability.

- [N] [[Eternal Return\|Eternal Return]] is the result and the repetition of the dicethrow, the reaffirmation of chance

- [N] The Eternal Return is the outcome of the dicethrow (affirmation of necessity) and the repetition/reaffirmation of the throw (affirmation of chance).
- [N] It is both the result and the repeating action of the game of existence.

> The Eternal Return is understood as both the necessary outcome (result) and the active repetition (return) of the dicethrow, embodying the simultaneous affirmation of chance and necessity.

- [N] Focusing on probabilities is likened to slaves trying to act as masters.
- [N] The crucial act is to affirm the fatal, necessary number resulting from chance, not probable outcomes.

> Focusing on statistical probabilities is seen as a superficial, reactive approach ("slaves speaking as masters") compared to affirming the singular, fatal, and necessary outcome of chance.

### Circular Movement and Chaos as Original Law

<mark class="hltr-yellow">"There was not first of all chaos, then little by little a regular and circular movement of all the forms: on the contrary, all this is eternal, removed from becoming; if there ever was a chaos of forces the chaos was eternal and has reappeared in every cycle . Circular movement has not come into being, it is the original law, in the same way as the mass of force is the original law without exception or possible infraction. All becoming happens inside of the cycle and the mass of force" (VP II 325 - circular movement = cycle, mass of force = chaos).</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=52&annotation=DZZA5YTF)
- [N] Circular movement is the original law (cycle), all becoming happens inside the cycle and chaos

- [N] Circular movement (cycle) and the mass of force (chaos) are presented as original, eternal laws, not products of evolution.
- [N] Becoming occurs *within* this eternal cycle and chaos.

> Nietzsche's cosmology posits circular movement (the cycle) and the mass of force (chaos) as original, eternal laws, not evolutionary outcomes. All becoming unfolds within this framework.

- [N] Fire symbolizes the power of affirming multiplicity simultaneously.
- [N] Fire is the element of play and transformation, without an opposite.
- [N] The imagery links fire to the earth broken by the dicethrow, representing creative transformation.

> Fire is used as a symbol for the affirmative power that embraces multiplicity and transformation, embodying the dynamic, unopposed element of play in the universe.

- [N] Mallarme discusses the dicethrow as realized by nihilism, denying existence, interpreted in the perspective of bad conscience, ressentiment

- [N] Mallarme's points connect thinking, playing (which man struggles with), the dicethrow as a tragic/superhuman act, and the resulting constellation as a work of art.
- [N] The dicethrow's meaning is lost if separated from innocence, affirmation of chance, or if chance and necessity are opposed.
- [N] Mallarme interprets the dicethrow through nihilism, bad conscience, and ressentiment.

> This section compares Nietzsche's ideas to Mallarme, noting parallels in the symbolism of the dicethrow, but highlighting that Mallarme's interpretation is colored by nihilism, bad conscience, and ressentiment, unlike Nietzsche's affirmative perspective.

- [N] The presence or absence of ressentiment is presented as the fundamental "transcendental" or genealogical difference between types.

> Revenge is identified as a pervasive instinct that has corrupted key areas of human thought and history. The distinction between having or not having ressentiment is presented as a fundamental, genealogical difference determining type.

### Affirmative Thought and Eternal Return

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The phrase "a new way of thinking" means an affirmaÂ­tive thought, a thought which affirms life and the will to life, a thought which fmally expels the whole of the negative; to believe in the innocence of the future and the past, to believe in the eternal return.</mark> [Page 58](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CCT8YKQQ)
- [N] :)

- [N] A "new way of thinking" is affirmative, affirming life and the will to life, and expelling the negative.
- [N] This new thought involves believing in the innocence of past/future and the eternal return.

> A fundamental "new way of thinking" is characterized by affirmation of life and the will to life, rejecting negativity and embracing the innocence of time and the eternal return.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">"Will, this is what the liberator and the messenger of joy is called" (Z II "Of Redemption").</mark> [Page 59](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=59&annotation=9KER6WHD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">to will = to create . We have not understood that the tragic is pure and multiple positivity, dynamic gaeity . Affirmation is tragic because it affirms chance and the necessity of chance; because it affirms multiplicity and the unity of multiplicity. The dicethrow is tragic .

- [N] ðŸ”¥

- [N] Willing is equated with creating and is a source of liberation and joy.
- [N] The tragic is pure, multiple positivity and dynamic joy, stemming from affirming chance, necessity, multiplicity, and unity.
- [N] The tragic dicethrow embodies this affirmation.
- [N] Nihilism, Christian/dialectical pathos, and bad conscience are mere caricatures of the tragic.

> Willing is fundamentally creative and joyful. The tragic is understood as pure, dynamic affirmation of chance, necessity, multiplicity, and unity (embodied by the dicethrow), contrasting sharply with the negative pathos of nihilism, Christianity, and dialectics.

### Playing vs. Betting, Dancing vs. Leaping

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Zarathustra, without preconceptions, opposes playing to betting and dancing to leaping: it is the bad player who bets and above all it is the buffoon who leaps, who thinks that leaping means dancing, overÂ­ coming, going beyond</mark> [Page 60](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=60&annotation=8BZDZSGU)

- [N] Zarathustra contrasts genuine playing (embracing the game/chance) with betting (seeking calculated outcomes), and dancing (affirmative movement) with mere leaping (superficial overcoming).

> Zarathustra distinguishes between authentic engagement (playing, dancing) and superficial actions (betting, leaping) which mistake mere effort or calculation for genuine affirmation and transcendence.

### Overcoming Chaos and Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This prophecy we have fulfilled" (VP III 42/WP 83). Nietzsche means that we have managed to discover another game , another way of playing: we have discovered the Overman beyond two human-all-too-human ways of existing; we have managed to make chaos an object of affirmaÂ­ tion instead of positing it as something to be denied.</mark> [Page 60](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=60&annotation=42Z8V4UY)
- [N] Opposed to Pascal's wager

- [N] A new way of "playing" has been discovered, leading to the Overman.
- [N] This involves affirming chaos rather than denying it (contrasting with Pascal's wager which attempts to impose order/purpose).

> Nietzsche suggests a new, affirmative way of engaging with existence ("another game") that embraces chaos rather than denying it, leading to the emergence of the Overman.

### Eternal Return: Being of Becoming, Identity of Returning

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What is the being of that which becomes, of that which neither starts nor fmishes becoming? ReturÂ­ning is the being of that which becomes (Revenir, l'etre de ce qui devient). "That everything recurs is the closest approximation of a world of becoming to a world of being - high point of the meditation" (VP II 1 70/WP 617).</mark> [Page 71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YWKU6UKL)

<mark class="hltr-green">We misinterpret the expression "eternal return" if we understand it as "return of the same" . It is not being that returns but rather the returning itself that constitutes being insofar as it is affirmed of becoming and of that which passes. It is not some one thing which returns but rather returning itself is the one thing which is affirmed of diversity or multiplicity. In other words, identity in the eternal return does not describe the nature of that which returns but, on the contrary, the fact of returning for that which differs.</mark> [Page 71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBKQ3YNK)

- [N] The being of becoming is returning itself ("Revenir, l'etre de ce qui devient").
- [N] Eternal Return is not the return of the same, but returning itself as the being of becoming.
- [N] Identity in eternal return refers to the fact of *returning* for that which *differs*, not the nature of what returns.

> The first aspect of the eternal return, as a cosmological/physical principle, defines "being" as the act of "returning" itself, inherent in becoming. Identity lies in the *fact* of returning for that which differs, not in the return of identical things.

### Against Cycles, Towards Will to Power

<mark class="hltr-green">The cyclical hypothesis is incapable of accounÂ­ting for two things - the diversity of co-existing cycles and, above all, the existence of diversity within the cycle. 9 This is why we can only understand the eternal return as the expression of a principle which serves as an explanation of diversity and its reproduction, of differÂ­ ence and its repetition. Nietzsche presents this principle as one of his most important philosophical discoveries. He calls it will to power. By will to power "I express the characteristic that cannot be thought out of the mechanistic order without thinking away this order itself'' (VP II 374/WP 634*).</mark> [Page 72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2S9557FW)
- [N] Against the cyclical, [[Will to Power\|Will to Power]]

- [N] The cyclical hypothesis fails to explain diversity within and across cycles.
- [N] Eternal Return is understood through the principle of will to power, which explains the repetition of difference and reproduction of diversity.
- [N] Will to power is a characteristic inseparable from the mechanistic order.

> The eternal return is not simply a cyclical return, as cycles cannot account for diversity. Instead, it is grounded in the principle of the will to power, which explains the repetition of difference and the reproduction of diversity, even within a mechanistic framework.

### Will to Power as Genealogical Element of Force

<mark class="hltr-blue">"The victorious concept 'force', by means of which our physicists have created God and the world, still needs to be completed: an inner will must be ascribed to it, which I designate as 'will to power' " (VP II 309/WP 619). The will to power is thus ascribed to force , but in a very special way: it is both a complement of force and something internal to it. It is not ascribed to it as a predicate. Indeed, if we pose the question "which one", we cannot say that force is the one that wills. The will to power alone is the one that wills, it does not let itself be delegated or alienated to another subject, even to force (VP I 204, II 54; "Who therefore will power? An absurd question, if being is by itself will to power ... ")</mark> [Page 72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2CMFBEA)
- [N] [[Will to Power\|Will to Power]]

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is what the will to power is; the genealogical element of force, both differential and genetic . The will to power is the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation .

- [N] Will to power is an inner will ascribed *to* force, complementing it but not being a predicate of force itself.
- [N] Will to power alone is "the one that wills."
- [N] Will to power is the genealogical, differential, and genetic element of force, determining quantitative differences and resulting qualities.
- [N] Will to power is the principle synthesizing forces.
- [N] Force is *what can*; Will to power is *what wills*.

> Will to power is presented not as a property of force but as the inner, differential, and genetic element *within* force that constitutes its nature and relations. It is "what wills" in force, determining the quantitative differences and qualitative outcomes (active/reactive) and acting as the principle synthesizing forces.

### Will to Power, Chance, and Qualities

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The will to power as a principle does not suppress chance but, on the contrary, implies it, because without chance it would be neither plastic nor changing.</mark> [Page 76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U7BHHZ8U)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Forces are said to be dominant or dominated depending on their difference in quantity . Forces are said to be active or reactive depenÂ­ding on their quality .

- [N] Active/reactive forces

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Affirming and denying, appreciating and depreciating, express the will to power just as acting and reacting express force . (And just as reactive forces are still forces, the will to deny, nihilism, is still will to power: " ... a will to nothingness, an aversion to life, a rebellion against the most fundaÂ­ mental presuppositions of life; but it is and remains a will!" GM III 28 p. 1 63)</mark> [Page 77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I7Y4LVGB)
- [N] Affirmative and negative to designate qualities of will to power.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Affirmation is not action but the power of becoming active, becoming active personified. Negation is not simple reaction but a becoming reactive . It is as if affirmation and negation were both immanent and transcendent in relation to action and reacÂ­tion; out of the web of forces they make up the chain of becoming.</mark> [Page 77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5D56FKGN)
- [N] The chain of becoming

- [N] Will to power implies chance, which allows for plasticity and change.
- [N] Forces are dominant/dominated by quantity, active/reactive by quality. Will to power is in both active and reactive forces.
- [N] Affirming/denying are qualities of will to power, just as acting/reacting are qualities of force.
- [N] Nihilism (will to nothingness) is still a form of will to power.
- [N] Affirmation is the *power* of becoming active; negation is a *becoming* reactive.
- [N] Affirmation and negation create the chain of becoming out of the web of forces.

> Will to power incorporates chance, is present in both active and reactive forces, and expresses itself through the qualities of affirming and denying (nihilism being a mode of denying). Affirmation is the power behind becoming active, while negation is a becoming reactive, together forming the dynamic chain of becoming.

### Reactive Forces Decompose Active Forces

<mark class="hltr-yellow">even by getting together reactive forces do not form a greater force, one that would be active . They proceed in an entirely different way - they decompose; they separate active force from what it can do ; they take away a part or almost all of its power . In this way reactive forces do not become active but, on the contrary, they make active forces join them and become reactive in a new sense.</mark> [Page 80](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHN6DDZH)

### Hierarchy

<mark class="hltr-purple">10. Hierarchy</mark> [Page 82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/285G5YQ8)

### Facts Used by the Weak

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Because it does not take the qualities offorces into account free thought is, by vocation, at the service of reactive forces and expresses their triumph. For the fact is always something used by the weak against the strong; "the fact is always stupid, having at all times resembled a calf rather than a god" (UM II "Use and Abuse of History" 8).</mark> [Page 83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JUR2L3EB)

<mark class="hltr-blue">"There are no facts, nothing but interpretations" (VP II 1 33).</mark> [Page 83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HQKZMEX7)

- [N] "Free thought," ignoring the quality of forces, can serve reactive forces.
- [N] "Facts" are often tools used by the weak against the strong.
- [N] Nietzsche's famous dictum "There are no facts, only interpretations" supports this view that objective facts are not primary but products of interpretation/power dynamics.

> "Facts" are not neutral but can be tools wielded by the weak against the strong. Nietzsche's perspectivism, stating there are only interpretations, aligns with the idea that even what is considered a "fact" serves a particular power dynamic.

- [N] The reign of law and virtue

- [N] Hierarchy has two meanings: 1) the natural superiority of active forces over reactive ones, and 2) the organized triumph and proliferation of reactive forces (e.g., through law and virtue).

> Hierarchy can refer either to the inherent superiority of active forces or to the artificial dominance and organization achieved by reactive forces.

### Relative Accomplishment and Strength

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The least strong is as strong as the strong if he goes to the limit, because the cunning, the subtelty, the wit and even the charm by which he makes up for his lesser strength are part of this strength so that it is no longer the least.

The eagle is strong and proud but the serpent being crafty and charming is no less strong.)</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CCYIXIQ)
- [N] Relative accomplishment, do what you do and do it to the best of your ability

- [N] One's strength is not solely based on quantity but also includes qualities like cunning and wit, which can make the "least strong" equally effective if they maximize their capacities.
- [N] The symbolism of the eagle and serpent illustrates different forms of strength.

> Strength is not a simple measure of quantity but includes qualities like cunning and wit. Maximizing one's unique capacities, regardless of conventional strength, constitutes a form of power, exemplified by the serpent alongside the eagle.

### Definitions of Reactive and Active Force

<mark class="hltr-orange">reactive force is: 1) utilitarian force of adaptation and partial limitaÂ­ tion; 2) force which separates active force from what it can do, which denies active force (triumph of the weak or the slaves); 3) force separated from what it can do, which denies or turns against itself (reign of the weak or of slaves).</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9T5YU9PM)
- [N] Reactive force

<mark class="hltr-orange">active force is: 1) plastic , dominant and subjugating force; 2) force which goes to the limit of what it can do; 3) force which affirms its difference, which makes its difference an object of enjoyment and affirmation.</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VSLGDXJD)
- [N] Active force

- [N] Reactive force is characterized by adaptation/limitation, separating active force from its capacity, and turning against itself.
- [N] Active force is characterized by plasticity/domination, going to its limit, and affirming/enjoying its own difference.

> This provides explicit definitions: reactive force is utilitarian, limiting, and self-negating, while active force is plastic, maximizing its potential, and affirming its own difference.

<mark class="hltr-blue">will to power rules even in the inorganic world, or rather that there is no inorganic world.

### Will to Power, Sensibility, and Becoming Sensible

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The active and the reactive are qualities of force that derive from the will to power. But the will to power itself has qualities, sensibilia , which are like the becomings of forces. The will to power manifests itself, in the first place, as the sensibility of forces and, in the second place, as the becoming sensible of forces: pathos is the most elementary fact from which a becoming arises (VP II 3 1 1 /WP 635 )</mark> [Page 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3G9QRVQD)

### Triumph of Reactive Forces as Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It must not be said that active force becomes reactive because reactive forces triumph; on the conÂ­trary, they triumph because, by separating active force from what it can do, they betray it to the will of nothingness, to a becoming-reactive deeper than themselves. This is why the figures of triumph of reactive forces (ressentiment, bad conscience, and the ascetic ideal) are primarily forms of nihilism.</mark> [Page 87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DJYFR4MR)
- [N] Reactive forces triumph because they separate active forces from what it can do, betrays it to the will of nothingness, nihilism

- [N] Reactive forces triumph *because* they separate active forces from their capacity, betraying them to the will to nothingness.
- [N] This separation leads to a deeper "becoming-reactive."
- [N] The triumph of reactive forces (ressentiment, bad conscience, ascetic ideal) are forms of nihilism.

> Reactive forces gain dominance not by becoming strong themselves, but by weakening active forces and leading them towards a "becoming-reactive" rooted in the will to nothingness. The triumph of reactive forces is therefore fundamentally a triumph of nihilism.

### Overcoming Nihilism: Becoming the Overman

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In order to affirm the eternal return it is necessary to bite off and spit out the snake's head.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">One reactive force both obeys and resists, another separates active force from what it can do; a third contaminates active force, carries it along to the limit ofbecoming-reactive, into the will to nothingness; a fourth type of reactive force was originally active but became reactive and separated from its power, it was then dragged into the abyss and turned against itself</mark> [Page 90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VTKL8H2I)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">in order to become active it is not sufficient for a force to go to the limit of what it can do, it must make what it can do an object of affirmation.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">becoming-active can only be thought as the product of a selection . A simultaneous double selection by the activity of force and the affirmation of the will.</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R44K8G5N)

<mark class="hltr-blue">"If, in all that you will you begin by asking yourself: is it certain that I will to do it an infinite number of times? This should be your most solid centre of gravity" (VP IV 242).</mark> [Page 91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FMX5GEMC)
- [N] Eternal Return

- [N] Becoming active is the result of a double selection: by force's activity and the will's affirmation.
- [N] The ethical test of the eternal return ("would you will this infinitely?") guides this selection of willing.

> The second aspect of the eternal return is its ethical dimension, functioning as a principle of selective thought where only that which can be willed infinitely is affirmed, driving a selection towards becoming active.

### Eternal Return Transmutes Nihilism into Affirmation

<mark class="hltr-green">The thought of the eternal return eliminates from willing everything which falls outside the eternal return, it makes willing a creation, it brings about the equation "willing = creating" .</mark> [Page 92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/63DU83F4)
- [N] The thought of the the eternal return, willing = creating

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Only the eternal return can complete nihilism because it makes negation a negation of reactive forces themselves. By and in the eternal return nihilism no longer expresses itself as the conservation and victory of the weak but as their destruction, their self-destruction .</mark> [Page 93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C38NA6NW)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">"it is the condition of strong spirits and wills, and these do not fmd it possible to stop with the negative of 'judgement'; their nature demands active negation" (VP III 1 02/WP 24). This is the only way in which reactive forces become active .</mark> [Page 93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M3SKCVJ5)
- [N] Self destruction, the reactive force of willing to nothingness, nihilism, is the only way reactive forces become active.

<mark class="hltr-blue">"eternal joy of becoming ... that joy which includes even joy in destroying", "The affirmation of passing away and destroying, which is the decisive feature of a Dionysian philosophy" (EH III</mark> [Page 93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7HF6BBF4)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the eternal return produces becoming-active .</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GJ5T7XB3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The small, petty, reactive man will not return. In and through the eternal return negation as a quality of the will to power transmutes itself into affirmation, it becomes an affirmation of negation itself, it becomes a power of affirming, an affirmative power. This is what Nietzsche presents as Zarathustra's cure and Dionysus' secret. "Nihilism vanÂ­quished by itself'' thanks to the eternal return (VP III).</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7YYP2FT4)
- [N] Nihilism vanquished by itself, will to power transmutes itself into affirmation, affirmation of negation itself, transmutation

- [N] The thought of eternal return purifies willing, equating it with creation.
- [N] Eternal return completes nihilism by turning its negation against reactive forces, leading to their self-destruction.
- [N] Reactive forces become active only through this "active negation" rooted in strong wills.
- [N] This involves the "joy of destroying" and affirming passing away.
- [N] Eternal return directly leads to becoming-active.
- [N] Through eternal return, negation as a quality of will to power transmutes into an affirmative power, vanquishing nihilism by turning it against itself.

> The eternal return is presented as the force that purifies willing into creation and overcomes nihilism by turning its destructive energy back onto reactive forces. This process transmutes negation into an affirmative power, leading to "becoming-active" and the vanquishing of nihilism from within itself.

### Eternal Return as Selective Being

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is no longer a question of the simple thought of the eternal return eliminating from willing everything that falls outside this thought but rather, of the eternal return making something come into being which cannot do so without changing nature. It is no longer a question of selective thought but of selective being; for the eternal return is being and being is selection. (Selection = hierarchy)</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGVUXKL5)
- [N] Selective being, selection = hierarchy

- [N] Eternal return is not just a thought that selects willing, but a principle of *selective being* that brings new natures into existence.
- [N] Eternal return *is* being, and this being is inherently selective (hierarchy).

> Moving beyond merely selective thought, the eternal return, as the principle of being itself, embodies a selective force that determines what exists and gives rise to new natures (selective being = hierarchy).

### Transmutation of Values

<mark class="hltr-orange">transmutation of values, or transvaluaÂ­tion , means affirmation instead of negation - negation transformed into a power of affirmation, the supreme Dionysian metamorphosis.</mark> [Page 94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HQY8LRLK)
- [N] Transmutation

- [N] Transmutation/transvaluation of values is defined as replacing negation with affirmation.
- [N] It is the transformation of negation into a power of affirmation, a "Dionysian metamorphosis."

> Transmutation of values is presented as a core concept: the transformation of negation itself into a force of affirmation, a Dionysian process that replaces a negative orientation with a positive one.

### Double Affirmation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">affirmation is twofold: the being of becoming cannot be fully affirmed without also affirming the existence of becomingÂ­ active .</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WIDCYFPP)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">eternal return thus has a double aspect: it is the universal being of becoming, but the universal being of becoming ought to belong to a single becoming. Only becoming-active has a being which is the being of the whole of becoming. Returning is everything but everything is affirmed in a single moment.</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QCC2E5NE)

<mark class="hltr-green">the complete formula of affirmation is: the whole, yes, universal being, yes, but universal being ought to belong to a single becoming, the whole ought to belong to a single moment.</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6J382QYI)

- [N] Affirmation is double: affirming the being of becoming and affirming becoming-active.
- [N] Eternal return has a double aspect: universal being of becoming AND this being belonging to a single becoming (becoming-active).
- [N] Only becoming-active embodies the being of the whole of becoming.
- [N] The complete formula of affirmation is: affirm the whole and universal being, but know that this being belongs to becoming-active and a single moment.

> Affirmation is understood as a double process: affirming the being inherent in all becoming and affirming the specific emergence of becoming-active. The eternal return encompasses this double affirmation, linking universal being to the singular moment of becoming-active.

### Active Philology and Linguistics

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The secret of the word is no more on the side of the one who hears than the secret of the will is on the side of the one who obeys or the secret of force on the side of the one who reacts.</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHN7E6NY)

<mark class="hltr-orange">Nietzsche's active philology has only one principle: a word only means2* something insofar as the speaker wills something by saying it; and one rule: treating speech as a real activity, placing oneself at the point of view of the speaker.</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IS3J3GSV)

<mark class="hltr-blue">Active linguistics looks to discover who it is that speaks and names. "Who uses a particular word, what does he apply it to first of all; himself, someone else who listens, something else, and with what intention?</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2777BU2)

<mark class="hltr-blue">What does he will by uttering a particular word?"</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYG84XPX)

- [N] The meaning of words, like will or force, is not found in the receiver (hearer, obedient, reactive) but in the sender (speaker, wielder, active).
- [N] Active philology/linguistics focuses on the speaker's will and treating speech as an activity.
- [N] The key question is "Who speaks/names?" and "What do they will by this word?".

> Nietzsche's approach to the "sciences of man" (like philology and linguistics) is "active," focusing on the creative agency and will of the speaker or agent, rather than the passive reception or reaction of the listener or object. Meaning resides in the wielder of force or will.

### Three Forms of Active Science and the Philosopher of the Future

<mark class="hltr-orange">A symptomatology, since it interprets phenomena, treating them as symptoms whose sense must be sought in the forces that produce them. A typology, since it interprets forces from the standpoint of their quality, be it active or reactive . A genealogy, since it evaluates the origin of forces from the point of view of their nobility or baseness, since it discovers their ancestry in the will to power and the quality of this will.</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VD66VJZE)
- [N] Three forms of active science

<mark class="hltr-orange">the "philosopher of the future": the philosopher-physician (the physician interprets symptoms), the philosopher-artist (the artist moulds types), the philosopher-legislator (the legislator determines rank, genealogy) (cf. PTG, VP IV).</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YF2X8GKW)

- [N] Active science takes three forms: Symptomatology (interpreting phenomena as symptoms of forces), Typology (interpreting forces by quality - active/reactive), and Genealogy (evaluating origin of forces by quality of will to power - nobility/baseness).
- [N] The philosopher of the future is a combination of physician (symptomatology), artist (typology), and legislator (genealogy).

> Nietzsche's vision for a transformed "science of man" involves three active forms: symptomatology (phenomena as symptoms of forces), typology (forces by quality), and genealogy (origin of forces by will to power quality). The future philosopher embodies these roles.

### Asking "Which One?"

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Asking which one is beautiful, which one is j ust and not what beauty is, what j ustice is, was therefore the result of a worked-out method, implying an original conception of essence and a whole sophistic art which was opposed to the dialectic . An empirical and pluralist art.</mark> [Page 99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M64JZS39)
- [N] Asking "which one?"

<mark class="hltr-orange">"which one?" (qui) means this: what are the forces which take hold of a given thing, what is the will that possesses it? Which one is expressed, manifested and even hidden in it?</mark> [Page 100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MB5LS5IQ)

<mark class="hltr-orange">essence is merely the sense and value of the thing; essence is determined by the forces with affinity for the thing and by the will with affinity for these forces</mark> [Page 100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2SE6GZ8)
- [N] We're led to essence by asking "which one?"

- [N] Nietzsche's method focuses on asking "which one?" (e.g., "Which one is beautiful?") instead of "What is...?" (e.g., "What is beauty?").
- [N] This empirical, pluralist approach opposes the dialectic.
- [N] "Which one?" investigates the forces and will possessing/expressed in a thing.
- [N] Essence is revealed by this method, being the sense and value determined by relevant forces and will.

> Nietzsche's distinctive philosophical method is characterized by asking "Which one?" rather than "What is...?" This approach aims to uncover the specific forces and will expressed in a phenomenon, revealing its essence as a matter of sense and value determined by these dynamics, in opposition to dialectical universalism.

### Nietzsche's Method

<mark class="hltr-purple">3. Nietzsche's Method</mark> [Page 101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SJS77T2U)

### Relating Concepts to Will to Power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Any given conÂ­cept, feeling or belief will be treated as symptoms of a will that wills something. What does the one that says this, that thinks or feels that, will? It is a matter of showing that he could not say, think or feel this particular thing if he did not have a particular will, particular forces, a particular way of being.</mark> [Page 101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DU6VJTPI)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The method is as follows: relating a concept to the will to power in order to make it the symptom of a will without which it could not even be thought (nor the feeling experienced, nor the action undertaken).</mark> [Page 101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6BUQ8JPM)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What a will wants is not an object, an objective or an end. Ends and objects, even motives, are still symptoms. What a will wants, depenÂ­ding on its quality, is to affirm its difference or to deny what differs.</mark> [Page 101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MG4V9YYA)
- [N] A will wants to affirm or deny difference

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What a will wants is always its own quality and the quality of the corresponding foreï¿½ï¿½.</mark> [Page 101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3DHW6R4)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We are demanding that the question be answered not by examples but by the determination of a type . And, a type is in fact constituted by the quality of the will to power, the nuance of this quality and the corresponding relation of forces: everything else is symptom.</mark> [Page 102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U95WZ9R2)
- [N] Determination of type

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A type can only be defined by determining what the will wants in the exampÂ­lars of this type . What does the one that seeks truth want? This is the only way of knowing which one seeks truth</mark> [Page 102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPZF44IL)

- [N] Concepts, feelings, and beliefs are treated as symptoms of a specific will/forces/way of being.
- [N] The method links concepts to will to power, revealing the will necessary for that thought/feeling/action.
- [N] A will doesn't want objects/ends; it wants to affirm or deny difference.
- [N] A will seeks its own quality and the quality of its forces.
- [N] The method aims at determining a "type," defined by the quality of will to power and force relations.
- [N] Understanding "which one" seeks truth means understanding what the will *wants* in that person.

> Nietzsche's method involves interpreting all concepts, feelings, and beliefs as symptoms of an underlying will to power. This method seeks to determine the "type" of will and forces at play, defining a type not by its objects or ends, but by its fundamental quality (affirmation/denial of difference).

### Misunderstanding 1: Power as Representation

<mark class="hltr-blue">" For what does not exist cannot will; but that which is alive , how</mark> [Page 102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q3HYX5IS)

<mark class="hltr-blue">could it still will to live?"</mark> [Page 103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NJ4627IH)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) Power is interpreted as the object of a representation . In the expresÂ­ sion "the will wants power or desires domination", the relation of representation and power is so close that all power is represented and every representation is of power. The aim of the will is also the object of representation and vice versa.</mark> [Page 103](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AUADMJI9)
- [N] Misunderstanding #1 - representation of power

- [N] A major misunderstanding of predecessors is interpreting power as something to be represented or desired as an object.
- [N] This creates a problematic link between representation and the will's aim.

> Nietzsche critiques predecessors for misunderstanding power as a representational object that the will desires, thereby limiting its true nature.

#on/willtopower #on/misunderstanding #on/representation

### Misunderstanding 2: Recognition and Established Values

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What we present to ourselves as power itself is merely the representation of power formed by the slave. What we present to ourselves as the master is the idea of him formed by the slave , the idea formed by the slave when he imagines himself in the master's place, it is the slave as he is when he actually triumphs</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AUWYSIVL)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When we make power an object of representation we necessarily make it dependent upon the factor according to which a thing is represented or not, recognised or not. Now, only values which are already current, only accepted values, give criteria of recognition in this way.</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833GRTX2)
- [N] Misunderstanding #2 - recognition

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the whole conception of the will to power, from Hobbes to Hegel, presupposes the existence of establish values that wills seek only to have attributed to themÂ­ selves.</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J7H5FA5W)

- [N] The conventional idea of power/master is often the slave's representation, projected when the slave triumphs.
- [N] Represented power relies on recognition, which is tied to existing, accepted values.
- [N] Predecessors like Hobbes and Hegel presuppose established values that wills merely seek to acquire or be recognized for.

> A second misunderstanding is linking power to recognition, which ties it to existing, conventional values. This is seen as the slave's perspective, where wills seek only attribution within a pre-established value system.

#on/willtopower #on/misunderstanding #on/recognition #on/values

### Misunderstanding 3: Struggle

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is characterisÂ­tic of established values to be brought into play in a struggle, but it is characteristic of the struggle to be always referred to established values: whether it is struggle for power, struggle for recognition or struggle for life - the schema is always the same. One cannot over emphasise the extent to which the notions of struggle, war, rivalry or even comparison are foreign to Nietzsche and to his conception of the will to power.</mark> [Page 105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R7NXH85M)
- [N] Misunderstanding #3 - struggle

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Struggle is never the active expression of forces, nor the manifestation of a will to power that affirms - any more than its result expresses the triumph of the master or the strong. Struggle, on the contrary is the means by which the weak prevail over the strong because they are the greatest" number.</mark> [Page 105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MLPDJK6)
- [N] Struggle is never an active expression of forces, nor will to power that affirms

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Darwin confused struggle and selection. He failed to see that the result of struggle was the opposite of what he thought; that it does select, but it selects only the weak and assures their triumph (VP I 395 , TI).</mark> [Page 105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D4UKCRHV)
- [N] [[Darwin\|Darwin]] confused struggle with selection

- [N] The concept of struggle (for power, recognition, life) is foreign to Nietzsche's will to power.
- [N] Struggle is seen as a means for the weak (in number) to prevail, not an active expression of force or affirmation of will to power.
- [N] Darwin is critiqued for confusing struggle and selection, as struggle often selects for the weak.

> A third misunderstanding is interpreting will to power through concepts like struggle, war, or rivalry. These are seen not as active expressions of force but as mechanisms by which the weak (often in numbers) gain dominance, contrasting sharply with Nietzsche's affirmative will to power.

### Fettered Will and Appearance

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Hobbes the will to power is as if in a dream from which only the fear of death will rescue it. Hegel insists on the unreality of the situation of the master, for the master depends on the slave for recognition. Everyone puts contradiction into the will and also the will into conÂ­tradiction. Represented power is only appearance; the essence of the will does not establish itself in what is willed without losing itself in appearance .</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TZHMJL8Z)
- [N] Represented power is only appearance, 5us placing a limitation on will

- [N] Philosophers like Hobbes and Hegel limit the will (e.g., by fear, dependence on recognition) and introduce contradiction into it.
- [N] Represented power is seen as mere appearance, where the will loses its essence.

> Philosophers who portray will as limited or contradictory (like Hobbes' will constrained by fear or Hegel's master's will dependent on the slave) reduce true power to mere appearance.

### Schopenhauer's Will, Representation, and Denial

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Schopenhauer is not content with an essence of the will, he makes the will the essence of things, "the world seen from the inside" . The will has become essence in general and in itself. But, on this basis, what it wants (its objectification) has become representation, appearÂ­ance in general. Its contradiction become the basic contradiction: as essence it wills the appearance in which it is reflected. "The fate which awaits the will in the world in which it is reflected" is just the suffering of this contradiction. This is the formula of the will to live; the world as will and representation.</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7NZYH8Q8)
- [N] [[Schopenhauer\|Schopenhauer]]'s world of will and representation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">By making will the essence of the world Schopenhauer continues to understand the world as an illusion, an appearance, a representation (BGE 36, VP I 216 and III 325). Limiting the will is therefore not going to be enough for Schopenhauer. The will must be denied, it must deny itself. The Schopenhauerian choice: "We are stupid beings or, at best, beings who suppress themselves" (VP III 40).</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JTWM5MV6)
- [N] The world is an illusion, appearance, representation, thus the Will must be denied, denies itself

- [N] Schopenhauer makes the will the essence of the world ("world seen from the inside").
- [N] This leads him to see the world of "what the will wants" (objectification) as mere representation/appearance.
- [N] The fundamental contradiction is the will willing the appearance that causes its suffering.
- [N] Seeing the world as appearance/illusion leads Schopenhauer to advocate for the will's self-denial.

> Schopenhauer, by making will the essence of reality, paradoxically condemns the world of its manifestations as mere suffering appearance, leading him to advocate for the self-denial of the will, a path Nietzsche rejects.

### Principles for the Philosophy of the Will

<mark class="hltr-purple">6. Principles for the Philosophy of the Will</mark> [Page 107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HCPX66PL)

### Willing = Creating, Will = Joy

<mark class="hltr-blue">"willing = creating" and "will = joy"</mark> [Page 107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FV2DSIQF)
- [N] Two principles of the philosophy of the will

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Against this fettering of the will Nietzsche announces that willing liberates; against the suffering of the will Nietzsche announces that the will is joyful. Against the image of a will which dreams of having established values attributed to it Nietzsche announces that to will is to create new values.</mark> [Page 108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XZ4EWIRE)

- [N] Two core principles: "willing = creating" and "will = joy."
- [N] This opposes the idea of a fettered or suffering will.
- [N] True willing is the creation of new values, not seeking recognition for existing ones.

> The foundational principles of Nietzsche's philosophy of the will are that willing is synonymous with creation and that will is inherently joyful, liberating itself from constraints and generating new values.

#on/will #on/creation #on/joy #on/values

### Will to Power is Creative and Bestowing

<mark class="hltr-yellow">power is never measured against representation: it is never represented, it is not even interpreted or evaluated, it is "the one that" interprets, "the one that" evaluates, "the one that" wills.</mark> [Page 108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KZZ3Q3DN)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What the will to power wills is a particular relation of forces, a particular quality of forces. And also a particular quality of power: affirming or denying.</mark> [Page 108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5STGI7VN)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the will to power is essentially creative and giving: it does not aspire, it does not seek, it does not desire, above all it does not desire power . It gives: power is something inexpressible in the will (something mobile, variable, plastic); power is in the will as "the bestowing virtue" , through power the will itself bestows sense and value .</mark> [Page 108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FDSR9G)

- [N] Will to power is not measured by or subject to representation, interpretation, or evaluation; it is the active source that *performs* these actions.
- [N] Will to power wills specific relations/qualities of forces and qualities of power (affirming/denying).
- [N] Will to power is inherently creative and "giving" ("bestowing virtue"), not seeking or desiring power as an object.
- [N] Through will to power, will bestows sense and value.

> Will to power is defined as the inherent, creative force that bestows sense and value, rather than being an object of desire or representation. It is the source of interpretation and evaluation, willing specific qualities of forces and affirmation/denial.

### Critique, Transmutation, and Nobility

<mark class="hltr-orange">The element which creates sense and values must also be defined as the critical element.</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3RCY67QP)

<mark class="hltr-orange">High and noble designate, for Nietzsche, the superiority of active forces, their affmity with affirmaÂ­ tion, their tendency to ascend, their lightness. Low and base designate the triumph of reactive forces, their affmity with the negative, their heaviness or clumsiness.</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FXBVSYGY)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The test of the eternal return will not let reactive forces subsist, any more than it will let the power of denying subsist. The eternal return transmutes the negative: it turns the heavy into something light, it makes the negative cross over to affirmation, it makes negation a power of affirming.</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3K9M5SVI)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Critique is destruction as joy, the aggression of the creator. The creator of values cannot be distinguished from a desÂ­ troyer, from a criminal or from a critic : a critic of established values, reactive values and baseness.</mark> [Page 110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4RJTQSJ3)

- [N] The creative element that bestows sense/value is also critical.
- [N] "Noble" is linked to active forces, affirmation, lightness; "base" to reactive forces, negation, heaviness.
- [N] Eternal return acts as a test, transmuting the negative/heavy into affirmation/lightness, making negation an affirmative power.
- [N] Critique is joyful destruction, inseparable from creation, targeting established/reactive/base values.

> The creative element is also critical, evaluating based on the distinction between noble (active, light) and base (reactive, heavy) forces. The eternal return facilitates a transmutation where the negative is transformed into affirmative power. Critique is the joyful destruction required for creation.

<mark class="hltr-orange">Nietzsche presents ressentiment as "an imagiÂ­nary revenge", "an essentially spiritual vindication" (GM I 7 and 1 0). Moreover, the constitution of ressentiment implies a paralogism that Nietzsche analyses in detail: the paralogism of force separated from what it can do (GM I 1 3).</mark> [Page 110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KG7KATZP)
- [N] Ressentiment

<mark class="hltr-orange">bad conscience is inseparable from "spiritual and imaginary events" (GM II 1 8). Bad conscience is by nature antinomic , expressing a force which is turned against itself. 15 In this sense it is the basis of what Nietzsche calls "the inverted world" (GM III 14 p. 1 24).</mark> [Page 110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBTURMWW)
- [N] Bad conscience

<mark class="hltr-orange">the ascetic ideal refers to the deepest mystification - that of the /deal, which includes all the others, all the fictions of morality and knowledge. Elegantia syllogismi, Nietzsche says. Here we are dealing with a will that wants nothingness, "but it is at least, and always remains, a will" (GM III 28).</mark> [Page 111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KXZ74F8N)
- [N] The ascetic ideal

- [N] Ressentiment, bad conscience, and the ascetic ideal are key manifestations of the triumph of reactive forces and forms of nihilism.
- [N] Ressentiment is imaginary revenge/vindication, based on the fiction of force separated from capacity.
- [N] Bad conscience is an antinomic force turned against itself, the basis of the "inverted world."
- [N] The ascetic ideal is the deepest mystification (the Idea), rooted in a will that desires nothingness, yet is still a will.

> Deleuze outlines the three main figures analyzed in *Genealogy of Morals* (ressentiment, bad conscience, ascetic ideal) as the manifestations of the triumph of reactive forces and core forms of nihilism, each based on a specific distortion or self-negation of force/will.

### Critique of Dialectic's Anthropocentrism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">dialectic , this new critique, carefully avoids asking the preliminary question: "Who must underÂ­take critique, who is fit to undertake it?" They talk of reason, spirit, self-consciousness and man; but to whom do all these concepts refer? They do not tell us who man or spirit is.</mark> [Page 111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2R9NVPFQ)
- [N] Dialectic

- [N] Dialectical critique fails to ask the fundamental question of "Who" is performing the critique (the type of subject/force).
- [N] It uses abstract concepts like reason, spirit, man, without defining the concrete "who" behind them.

> Dialectical critique is limited by its failure to address the fundamental question of the "who" or the type of force/will that performs the critique, relying instead on abstract concepts like 'man' or 'reason'.

### Kant's Limited Critique

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Kant merely pushed a very old conception of critique to the limit, a concepÂ­tion which saw ï¿½ritique as a force which should be brought to bear on all claims to knowledge and truth, but not on knowledge and truth themselves; a force which should be brought to bear on all claims to morality, but not on morality itself.</mark> [Page 112](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NGLSK7ET)

- [N] Kant

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Critique is nothing and says nothing insofar as it is content to say that true morality makes fun of morality. Critique has done nothing insofar as it has not been brought to bear on truth itself, on true knowledge, on true morality, on true religion.</mark> [Page 113](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZL9VW6T7)

- [N] Kantian critique limits itself to judging claims *about* knowledge/truth/morality, but not these concepts themselves.
- [N] Kant's questions focus on the limits of human capacity ("What can I know?", "What should I do?", "What can I hope for?").
- [N] Critique is ineffective if it doesn't target truth, knowledge, and morality *themselves*.

> Kant's critique, while significant, is seen as limited because it only judges *claims* about knowledge, morality, and religion, rather than turning its critical force upon these fundamental concepts themselves. His focus is on the limits of human faculties.

### Nietzsche's Total Critique and Perspectivism

<mark class="hltr-orange">Nietzsche, in this domain as in others, thinks that he has found the only possible principle of a total critique in what he calls his "perspecÂ­ tivism" : there are no moral facts or phenomena, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena (VP II 5 50); there are no illusions of knowledge, but knowledge itself is an illusion; knowledge is an error, or worse, a falsification.</mark> [Page 113](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z6JSGMJ5)
- [N] Nietzsche's perspectives

- [N] Nietzsche's perspectivism offers a principle for a total critique.
- [N] There are only moral interpretations, not moral facts.
- [N] Knowledge itself is an illusion, error, or falsification, not just its limitations.

> Nietzsche's "perspectivism" is presented as the basis for a total critique that challenges the very foundation of concepts like morality and knowledge, arguing they are interpretations or illusions rather than objective facts or truths.

### Will to Power as Legislative Principle

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Only the will to power as genetic and genealogical principle, as legislative principle, is capable of realising internal critique . Only the will to power makes a transmutation possible .</mark> [Page 114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YIGVTKL7)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">that the philosopher, as philosopher, is not a sage, that the philosopher, as philosopher, ceases to obey, that he replaces the old wisdom by command, that he destroys the old values and creates new ones, that the whole of his science is legislative in this sense .</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X9XCFW43)

<mark class="hltr-blue">"Their 'knowing' is creating, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth is - will to power"</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/822HIDCZ)

- [N] Will to power, as a genetic/genealogical and legislative principle, enables genuine, internal critique and transmutation.
- [N] The philosopher, as a legislator of new values, replaces obedience with command and destroys old values.
- [N] The philosopher's "knowing" is creating, and their "will to truth" is will to power.

> The realization of total critique and transmutation is possible only through the will to power operating as a legislative, genetic, and genealogical principle. The philosopher embodies this by creating new values and commanding rather than obeying.

### Critique Aims at the Overman and a New Sensibility

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The aim of critique is not the ends of man or of reason but in the end the Overman, the overcome, overtaken man. The point of critique is not justification but a different way of feeling: another sensibility.</mark> [Page 117](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4ZA3Y8J)

- [N] The ultimate goal of Nietzschean critique is the emergence of the Overman (man overcome), not achieving the ends of man or reason.
- [N] The purpose of critique is not justification but cultivating a new sensibility or way of feeling.

> In terms of consequences, Nietzschean critique aims beyond the limits and goals of conventional humanity (man/reason), striving instead for the emergence of the Overman and the development of a new, affirmative sensibility.

### Truth, Morality, and the Ascetic Ideal

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the opposition of knowledge and life, the distinction between worlds, reveals its true character: it is a distincÂ­ tion of moral origin, an opposition of moral origin</mark> [Page 119](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FGIBZJI7)

<mark class="hltr-blue">"It has gradually become clear to me ... that the moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy have every time constituted the real germ of life out of which the entire plant has grown . . . I accordingly do not believe a "drive to knowledge" to be the father of philosophy" (BGE 6 p. 1 9)</mark> [Page 119](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R4WC4WGU)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The will to nothingness and reactive forces, these are the two constituent eleÂ­ments of the ascetic ideal.</mark> [Page 120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QY3CRXPL)

- [N] The opposition between knowledge and life (or different worlds) has a moral origin.
- [N] Philosophical drives are fundamentally rooted in moral (or immoral) intentions, not a pure drive for knowledge.
- [N] The ascetic ideal is formed by the will to nothingness and reactive forces.

> The apparent opposition between knowledge and life (or between different realms of existence) is fundamentally driven by moral intentions. The will to truth, tied to the ascetic ideal, is rooted in reactive forces and a will to nothingness.

### The Will to Truth and the Perishing of Morality

<mark class="hltr-blue">"After ChristÂ­ian truthfulness has drawn one inference after another, it must end by drawing its most striking inference , its inference against itself; this will happen, however, when it poses the question 'what is the meaning of all will to truth ?' And here again I touch on my problem, on our problem, my unknown friends (for I as yet know of no friend): what meaning would our whole being possess if it were not this, that in us the will to truth becomes conscious of itself as a problem? As the will to truth thus gains self-consciousness - there can be no doubt of that - morality will gradually perish now: this is the great spectacle in a hundred acts reserved for the next two centuries in Europe - the most terrible, most questionable and perhaps also the most hopeful of all spectacles"</mark> [Page 122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AM6I4DQD)

- [N] Christian truthfulness eventually leads to questioning the "will to truth" itself.
- [N] When the will to truth becomes self-conscious as a problem, morality begins to perish.
- [N] This process is seen as a potentially terrible but also hopeful spectacle for Europe.

> Nietzsche suggests that the internal logic of Christian truthfulness will inevitably lead to a critical questioning of the "will to truth" itself. When the will to truth becomes self-aware of its problematic nature, it signals the eventual demise of traditional morality, a prospect both terrible and hopeful.

### Thought and Life

<mark class="hltr-purple">13. Thought and Life</mark> [Page 123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GPC7KQ7D)

### Thought as Affirmative Power of Life

<mark class="hltr-green">But does not critique, understood as critique of knowledge itself, express new forces capable of giving thought another sense? A thought that would go to the limit of what life can do, a thought that would lead life to the limit of what it can do? A thought that would affirm life instead of a knowledge that is opposed to life. Life would be the active force of thought, but thought would be the affirmative power of life. Both would go in the same direction, carrying each other along, smashing restrictions, matching each other step for step, in a burst of unparalÂ­ leled creativity. Thinking would then mean discovering, inventing, new possibilities of life .</mark> [Page 124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ITVU3E4K)
- [N] Life as an active force

<mark class="hltr-yellow">life goes beyond the limits that knowledge fixes for it, but thought goes beyond the limits that life fixes for it. Thought ceases to be a ratio ,26* life ceases to be a reaction. The thinker thus expresses the noble affinity of thought and life: life making thought active, thought making life affirmative. In Nietzsche this general affinity is not only the pre-Socratic secret par excellence , but also the essence of art.</mark> [Page 124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FCVSSJMC)

- [N] Critique of knowledge can reveal new forces and senses for thought.
- [N] This leads to a thought that aligns with and extends the potential of life.
- [N] Life becomes the active force *of* thought, and thought becomes the affirmative power *of* life.
- [N] This reciprocal relationship between life and thought fuels creativity and the invention of new possibilities of life.
- [N] Thinking becomes discovering/inventing new life possibilities.
- [N] The noble affinity between thought and life (life activating thought, thought affirming life) is seen as a pre-Socratic secret and the essence of art.

> A critical approach can reveal a new relationship between thought and life: life becomes the active force of thought, and thought becomes the affirmative power of life. This mutual enhancement leads to unparalleled creativity and the invention of new ways of living, echoing a pre-Socratic wisdom and forming the essence of art.

<mark class="hltr-purple">14. Art</mark> [Page 125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N3D2UEGX)

### Art as Stimulant of Will to Power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Firstly, art is the opposite of a "disinterested" operation: it does not heal, calm, sublimate or pay off, it does not "suspend" desire, instinct or will. On the contrary, art is a "stimulant of the will to power", "something that excites willing" .</mark> [Page 125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2QCFKNM7)

- [N] Art is not disinterested; it stimulates the will to power and excites willing.

> Art is understood as a powerful stimulant for the will to power, directly engaging and exciting willing rather than being a detached or disinterested activity.

### Affirmation and Active Life

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Affirmation is the product of a way of thinking which presupposes an active life as its condition and concomitant</mark> [Page 125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B7HAKVCU)

- [N] Affirmation arises from a way of thinking rooted in and accompanied by an active life.

> Affirmation as a mode of thought is contingent upon an active life, suggesting a reciprocal relationship where active living supports affirmative thinking.

#on/affirmation #on/life #on/thought

### Art, Falsehood, and Affirmation of Appearance

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The second principle of art is as follows: art is the highest power of falsehood, it magnifies the "world as error" , it sanctifies the lie; the will to deception is turned into a superior ideal. 2</mark> [Page 125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SRR27JTR)

<mark class="hltr-green">It is art which invents the lies that raise falsehood to this highest affirmative power, that turns the will to deceive into something which is affirmed in the power of falsehood. For the artist, appearance no longer means the negation of the real in this world but this kind of selection, correction, redoubling and affirmation. 28 Then truth perhaps takes on a new sense . Truth is appearance . Truth means bringing of power into effect, raising to the highest power . In Nietzsche , "we the artists" = "we the seekers after knowledge or truth" = "we the inventors of new possibilities of life" .</mark> [Page 126](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B5DK8V53)
- [N] Awesome, on art

- [N] Art is the highest power of falsehood, affirming the "world as error" and sanctifying the lie.
- [N] Art elevates falsehood to an affirmative power, transforming the will to deception.
- [N] For the artist, appearance is not negation of reality but an affirmation through selection, correction, doubling.
- [N] This suggests a new sense of truth where truth is appearance, the actualization of power, or reaching the highest power.
- [N] Nietzsche equates "we the artists" with seekers of truth/knowledge and inventors of new life possibilities.

> Art embodies the highest power of falsehood, transforming the will to deception into an affirmative force. It treats appearance not as a negation of reality but as a means of selection and affirmation, suggesting a new understanding where truth resides in appearance and the actualization of power. Artists are equated with those who seek truth and create new possibilities for life.

- [N] dogmatic image of thought theses #2

<mark class="hltr-yellow">all we need to think well, to think truthfully, is a method . Method is an artifice but one through which we are brought back to the nature of thought, through which we adhere to this nature and ward off the effect of the alien forces which alter it and distract us. Through method we ward off error.</mark> [Page 126](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IP6HNYCE)
- [N] dogmatic image of thought theses #3

<mark class="hltr-yellow">When we speak of "plain truth" , of truth "in itself', "for itself' or even "for us", we must ask what forces are hiding themselves in the thought of this truth, and therefore what its sense and value is.</mark> [Page 127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6E4W2BQ8)

- [N] The traditional (dogmatic) image assumes the thinker inherently seeks truth.
- [N] It assumes thought is diverted from truth by external forces (body, passions).
- [N] It assumes method is sufficient to restore thought's truthful nature and ward off error.
- [N] Nietzsche counters that we must question the forces underlying the idea of "plain truth" and its sense/value.

> Nietzsche challenges the traditional "dogmatic image of thought" which assumes thought's inherent desire for truth, its distraction by external forces, and the sufficiency of method. Instead, he insists on questioning the forces and values behind the very concept of truth.

### New Image: Thought as Sense and Value

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A new image of thought means primarily that truth is not the element of thought. The element of thought is sense and value . The categories of thought are not truth and falsity but the noble and the base , the high and the low , depending on the nature of the forces that take hold of thought itself.</mark> [Page 127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LBHJJFUM)
- [N] New image of thought, sense and value

- [N] In the new image of thought, the primary element is sense and value, not truth.
- [N] Thought's categories become the noble/base, high/low, determined by the forces shaping thought.

> The "new image of thought" replaces truth/falsity with sense/value as the primary elements. Thought is understood in terms of the forces that possess it, categorizing concepts as noble or base.

### Thinking Actively and Untimely

<mark class="hltr-blue">Thinking actively is "acting in a non-present fashion, therefore against time and even on time, in favour (I hope) of a time to come"</mark> [Page 130](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VAFY5G8H)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Eternity, like the historicity of philosophy amounts to this: philosophy always untimely, untimely at every epoch.</mark> [Page 130](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DXMVCMN4)

- [N] Active thinking acts "against time," in favor of the future.
- [N] Philosophy is inherently "untimely," always standing apart from its present epoch.

> Active thinking operates against the current time, oriented towards a future. Philosophy's relationship to time is defined by its untimeliness across all epochs.

#on/thought #on/time #on/philosophy

### Thought Requires Violence and Forces

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Thinking is never the natural exercise of a faculty . Thought never thinks alone and by itself; moreover it is never simply disturbed by forces which remain external to it. ThinkÂ­ing depends on forces which take hold of thought.</mark> [Page 131](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQ75LLI5)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We are awaiting the forces capable of making thought something active, absolutely active, the power capable of making it an affirmation. Thinking, like activity, is always a second power of thought, not the natural exercise of a faculty, but an extraordinary event in thought itself, for thought itself. Thinking is the n-th power of thought. It is still necessary for it to become "light", "affirmative", "dancing" . But it will never attain this power if forces do not do violence to it. Violence must be done to it as thought, a power, the force of thinking, must throw it into a becoming-active .</mark> [Page 131](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2E26NAQR)
- [N] "We are not yet thinking"

- [N] Thinking is not a natural faculty but depends on forces that seize it.
- [N] Active thinking requires specific forces to "do violence" to thought, pushing it into becoming-active and making it affirmative/light/dancing.
- [N] True thinking is an extraordinary event, a heightened power of thought, not its default state.

> Thinking is not a passive or natural faculty but an active process requiring specific forces to "do violence" to it. It's a heightened state of "becoming-active" for thought itself, not its ordinary function, driven by external forces.

### Culture as Training and Selection by Force

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Culture, on the contrary, is a violence undergone by thought, a process of formation of thought through the action of selective forces, a training which brings the whole unconscious of the thinker into play.</mark> [Page 131](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PLDFT5Z2)
- [N] Culture is essentially training and selection, affirmative and active

- [N] Culture is understood as a form of violence/training upon thought by selective forces, involving the unconscious.
- [N] It is presented as an affirmative and active process of formation.

> Culture is interpreted as a process of violent training and formation of thought by selective forces, actively shaping the thinker's unconscious towards specific ends.

#on/culture #on/thought #on/force #on/selection

### Topology of Truth and Thought's Paideia

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The theory of forces depends on a typology of forces. And once again a typology begins with a topology . Thinking depends on certain coordinates. We have the truths that we deserve depending on the place we are carrying our existence to, the hour we watch over and the element that we frequent. There is nothing more false than the idea of "founts" of truth. We only find truths where they are, at their time and in their element. Every truth is truth of an element, of a time and a place: the minotaur does not leave the labyrinth (VP III 408). We are not going to think unless as we are forced to go where the forces which give food for thought are, where the forces that make thought something active and affirmative are made use of. Thought does not need a method but a paideia, a formation, a culture . Method in general is a means by which we avoid going to a particular place, or by which we maintain the option of escaping from it (the thread of the labyrinth). "And we, we beg you earnestly, hang yourselves with this thread!"</mark> [Page 133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SWDERGMR)
- [N] the new image of thought

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche says that three anecdotes are sufficient to define the life of a thinker (PTG) - one for the place, one for the time and one for the element. The anecdote is to life what the aphorism is to thought: something to interpret. Empedocles and his volcano - this is an anecdote of a thinker .</mark> [Page 133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKWKVCBD)

<mark class="hltr-green">The height of summits and caves, the labyrinths; midday-midnight; the halcyon aerial element and also the element of the subterranean. It is up to us to go to extreme places, to extreme times, where the highest and the deepest truths live and rise up. The places of thought are the tropical zones frequented by the tropical man, not temperate zones or the moral, methodical or moderÂ­ ate man.</mark> [Page 133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C5IGAG98)

- [N] Understanding forces requires a topology (mapping of places/elements).
- [N] Thinking is tied to specific coordinates (place, time, element); truths are found in specific contexts, not universal "founts."
- [N] Thinking requires being forced to go to where activating/affirming forces reside.
- [N] Thought needs *paideia* (formation/culture), not just method (which helps avoid difficult places).
- [N] A thinker's life can be defined by anecdotes of place, time, and element.
- [N] Truths are found in extreme "tropical" zones, not moderate/temperate ones.

> The "new image of thought" emphasizes that thinking and truth are bound to specific locations and elements (a topology of thought) and are not universally accessible via method. True thought requires a formation or *paideia* achieved by being forced into the extreme environments where activating and affirmative forces reside.

<mark class="hltr-orange">a reaction alone cannot constitute ressentiment. Ressentiment designates a type in which reactive forces prevail over active forces.

- [N] Active types incorporate reactive forces, but these forces are acted upon (obeying).
- [N] Ressentiment is a type where reactive forces triumph over active forces, not by strength, but by *ceasing to be acted upon*.
- [N] Reactive forces dominate by escaping the action of active forces.

> Ressentiment is characterized by a state where reactive forces overcome active forces, not through superior strength or activity, but by disengaging and refusing to be acted upon by the active forces.

- [N] When reactive forces (associated with mnemonic traces) target conscious excitations, the *reaction* to those excitations becomes *acted* upon by active forces. This means the reactive forces *can* be integrated and overcome by active forces under certain conditions related to consciousness and attention to current excitation rather than past traces.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A specific active force must be given the job of supporting consciousness and renewing its freshness, fluidity and mobile, agile chemistry at every moment.

- [N] Forgetting

- [N] Memories are unconsciously stored traces; consciousness emerges where mnemonic traces end.
- [N] The reactive unconscious is a system of passive, inescapable mnemonic traces.
- [N] Consciousness is a reactive force characterized by fresh receptivity.
- [N] When reactive forces target conscious excitation, the reaction can be *acted* upon by active forces.
- [N] Forgetting is a crucial active faculty that supports consciousness and prevents the reactive unconscious (traces) from dominating. Forgetting is an active, positive repression, absorption, and regenerative force.

> Ressentiment involves the interplay between the reactive unconscious (passive mnemonic traces) and reactive consciousness (fresh receptivity). Forgetting, an active faculty, is crucial to prevent the reactive unconscious from overwhelming consciousness and rendering reactions un-acted, which is key to preventing ressentiment.

### Ressentiment as Sickness

<mark class="hltr-yellow">as if the wax of consciousness were hardened, excitation tends to get confused with its trace in the unconscious and conversely, reaction to traces rises into consciousness and overruns it. Thus at the same time as reaction to traces becomes perceptible, reaction ceases to be acted. The consequences of this are immense: no longer being able to act a reaction, active force are deprived of the material conditions of their functioning, they no longer have the opportunity to do their job, they are separated from what they can do . We can thus finally see in what way reactive forces prevail over active forces: when the trace takes the place of the excitation in the reactive apparatus, reaction itself takes the place of action, reaction prevails over action.</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PVEFZY2P)
- [N] The importance of forgetting. Something beautiful about this.

<mark class="hltr-orange">ressentiment is a reaction which simultaneously becomes perceptible and ceases to be acted: a formula which defines sickness in general . Nietzsche is not simply saying that ressentiment is a sickness, but rather that sickness as such is a form of ressentiment</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8PA7QGRN)
- [N] Ressentiment

- [N] When the "wax of consciousness" hardens (forgetting fails), traces are confused with present excitation, and reactions to traces overwhelm consciousness.
- [N] This makes reactions perceptible but *un-acted*, separating active forces from their capacity.
- [N] Reactive forces triumph by replacing action with un-acted reaction to traces.
- [N] Ressentiment is defined as this state of perceptible, un-acted reaction, characterizing sickness itself. Sickness is a form of ressentiment.

> Ressentiment is fundamentally linked to the failure of forgetting, where past mnemonic traces overwhelm present excitation. This leads to reactions that are felt but not acted upon, crippling active forces and defining ressentiment as a form of sickness where reaction replaces action.

### Typology of Ressentiment

<mark class="hltr-purple">3. Typology of Ressentiment</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XYW8533G)

### Ressentiment and the Spirit of Revenge

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The man of ressentiment is characÂ­terised by the invasion of consciousness by mnemonic traces, the ascent of memory into consciousness itself.</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5RPF7FAB)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the man of ressentiment is like a dog, a kind of dog which only reacts to traces (a bloodhound). He only invests traces: for him excitation is locally confused with the trace, the man of ressentiment can no longer act his reaction.</mark> [Page 138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TRBFW5E6)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Whatever the force of the excitation which is received, whatever the total force of the subject itself, the man of ressentiment only uses the latter to invest the trace of the former, so that he is incapable of acting and even of reacting to the excitation. There is therefore no need for him to have experienced an excessive excitation. This may happen, but it is not necessary. He does not need to generalise in order to see the whole world as the object of his ressentiment. As a result of his type the man ofressentiment does not "react": his reaction is endless, it is felt instead of being acted. This reaction therefore blames its object, whatever it is, as an object on which revenge must be taken, which must be made to pay for this infinite delay.</mark> [Page 138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7X254RFG)
- [N] Spirit of revenge

<mark class="hltr-blue">"One cannot get rid of anything, one cannot get over anything, one cannot repel anything - everything hurts. Men and things obtrude too closely; experiences strike one too deeply; memory becomes a fesÂ­tering wound" (EH I 6 p. 320)</mark> [Page 139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QU3QQN7P)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This essential link between revenge and memory resembles the Freudian anal-sadistic complex. Nietzsche himself presents memeory as an unfinished digestion and the type of res sentiment as an anal type . 7 This intestinal and venomous memory is what Nietzsche calls the spider, the tarantula, the spirit of reveng</mark> [Page 139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KLAQAAB8)
- [N] frauds anal-sadistic complex

- [N] The man of ressentiment is defined by memory traces invading consciousness and an inability to act on reactions.
- [N] Like a bloodhound, he focuses solely on traces, his reaction is endless and felt, not acted.
- [N] This un-acted reaction leads him to blame its object and seek revenge for the delay.
- [N] Memory becomes a festering wound; the past cannot be overcome.
- [N] Nietzsche links this to a Freudian anal-sadistic complex and describes this memory as an "unfinished digestion" and the "spirit of revenge."

> The man of ressentiment is characterized by a reactive memory overwhelmed by traces, leading to an endless, un-acted reaction that fixates on blame and seeks revenge. This state is likened to an inability to digest the past and is tied to the "spirit of revenge."

### Characteristics of Ressentiment

<mark class="hltr-purple">4. Characteristics of Ressentiment</mark> [Page 139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXDC65VT)

### Ressentiment as Revolt of the Weak

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It gives revenge a means: a means of reversing the normal relation of active and reactive forces. This is why ressentiment itself is always a revolt and always the triumph of this revolt. Ressentiment is the triumph of the weak as weak, the revolt of the slaves and their victory as slaves. It is in their victory that the slaves form a type .</mark> [Page 140](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD2U7UER)

- [N] Ressentiment provides a means for revenge by reversing the power relation between active and reactive forces.
- [N] It is the revolt and triumph of the weak *as weak*, the victory of slaves *as slaves*, defining their type.

> Ressentiment serves as the vehicle for the weak to enact revenge and achieve triumph, not by becoming strong, but by reversing the active-reactive power dynamic and solidifying their identity as the victorious weak/slaves.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The man of ressentiment does not know how to and does not want to love, but wants to be loved</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TUJC4LMT)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the man of ressentiment is extremely touchy: faced with all the activities he cannot undertake he considers that, at the very least, he ought to be compensated by benefiting from them.</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ESEV6NMH)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">ressentiÂ­ment could only be imposed on the world through the triumph of the principle of gain, by making profit not only a desire and a way of thinking but an economic, social and theological system, a complete system, a divine mechanism.</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/972EVUYV)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A failure to recognise profit - this is the theological crime and the only crime against the spirit. It is in this sense that slaves have a morality , and that this morality is that of utility</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R297FP68)
- [N] Th slave morality of utility

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The imputation of wrongs, the distribution of responsibilities, perpetual accusation . All this replaces aggression. "The aggressive pathos belongs just as necessarily to strength as vengefulness and rancour belong to weakness" (EH I 7 p. 232).</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CNIC9ZQ4)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the dreadful feminine power of ressentiment: it is not content to denounce crimes and criminals, it wants sinners, people who are responsible . We can guess what the creature of ressentiment wants: he wants others to be evil, he needs others to be evil in order to be able to consider himself good. You are evil, therefore I am good; this is the slave's fundamental formula</mark> [Page 142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DIXDFT7H)

<mark class="hltr-blue">the essence of ressentiment: in order to exist, slave morality always first needs a hostile world" (GM I 10 pp. 36-37). The slave needs, to set the other up as evil from the outset.</mark> [Page 142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MS6YW566)

- [N] Ressentiment is characterized by inability to admire/respect/love (memory is hateful).
- [N] Happiness is seen as mere passivity/rest (reaction un-acted).
- [N] The man of ressentiment wants to be loved, not to love.
- [N] He is touchy and feels entitled to compensation/benefit for what he cannot do.
- [N] Ressentiment underlies a system based on "gain" or "profit," tied to a morality of utility (slave morality).
- [N] Accusation, responsibility, imputation replace active aggression.
- [N] Ressentiment's core desire is for others to be "evil" so the ressentiment-filled person can feel "good" ("You are evil, therefore I am good").
- [N] Slave morality fundamentally requires a hostile external world ("enemy").

> Key characteristics of ressentiment include inability to love, treating happiness as passive rest, seeking to be loved, touchiness, belief in compensation, and a morality of utility based on gain. It replaces active aggression with accusation and fundamentally requires designating an external "evil" to affirm its own (reactive) "goodness."

### Slave Morality: Evil vs. Good

<mark class="hltr-blue">"And he is good who does not outrage , who harms nobody, who does not attack, who does not requite, who leaves revenge to God, who keeps himself hidden as we do, who avoids evil and desires little from life, like us, the patient, humble and j ust" (GM I 13 p. 46)</mark> [Page 144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z8PURMMZ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good and evil are new values, but how strangely these values are created! They are created by reversing good and bad.

### The Paralogism

### The Fiction of Force Separated from Capacity

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the paralogism of ressentiment: the fiction of a force separated from what it can do .</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3Z7CPF7X)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The process of accusation in ressentiment fulfills this task: reactive forces "project" an abstract and neutralised image of force; such a force separated from its effects will be blameworthy if it acts, deserving, on the contrary, if it does not. Moreover it is thought that more (abstract) force is needed to hold back than is needed to act.</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C3YPUEQN)

- [N] Ressentiment relies on a "paralogism" or fiction: the idea of a force that can be separated from its capacity to act.
- [N] Reactive forces project a neutralized image of force, deeming it blameworthy when active and deserving when restrained, falsely valuing potential restraint over actualization.

> The "paralogism of ressentiment" is the central fiction that force can be separated from its capacity to act. Reactive forces use this fiction to morally condemn active force and value inaction.

#on/ressentiment #on/force #on/paralogism

### Moments of the Paralogism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) Moment of causality: force is split in two.</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7KH7PCJD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Force is first repressed into itself, then its manifestation is made into a different thing which finds its distinct, efficient cause in the force .</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/649L2Y83)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) MomerÂ· t of substance: force, which has been divided in this way, is projected into a substrate, into a subject which is free to manifest it or not.</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZE63BGTB)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">All subjects - the Epicureans' atom, Descartes' substance or Kant's thing-in-itself - are the projection of "little imaginery incubuses" (GM I 13 p. 141).</mark> [Page 146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTQTFEVR)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) Moment of reciprocal determination: the force thus neutralised is moralised.</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QCV78I6E)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">For the concrete distinction between forces, for the original difference between qualified forces (the good and the bad), is substituted the moral opposition between substantialised forces (good and evil).</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NBUQCW7B)

- [N] The paralogism has three steps: 1) Splitting force into cause and manifestation. 2) Projecting this force into a subject/substance (like philosophical concepts of substance or the self). 3) Moralizing the neutralized force, replacing real qualitative difference (good/bad) with moral opposition (good/evil).

> The paralogism of ressentiment unfolds in three moments: splitting force from its effect, projecting it onto a fictional subject/substance, and finally moralizing this abstracted force, replacing the true distinction of forces (good/bad) with the moral judgment (good/evil).

### Development of Ressentiment: the Judaic priest

<mark class="hltr-purple">7. Development of Ressentiment: the Judaic priest</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM6KVVXE)

### Two Aspects of Ressentiment

<mark class="hltr-orange">When Nietzsche speaks of bad conscience he explicitly distinguishes two aspects: a first in which bad conscience is in a "raw state", pure matter or a "question of animal psychology, no more"; a second, without which bad conscience would not be what it is, a moment which takes advantage of this previous content and makes it take form (GM HI 20).</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XRP57A7R)

<mark class="hltr-orange">Ressentiment also has two aspects or moments. The one , topologÂ­ ical, a question of animal psychology, constitutes ressentiment as raw content: it expresses the way in which reactive forces escape the action of active forces (displacement of reactive forces, invasion of consciousÂ­ness by the memory of traces). The second, typological, expresses the way in which ressentiment takes on form: the memory of traces becomes a typical character because it embodies the spirit of revenge and engages in an enterprise of perpetual accusation; reactive forces are then opposed to active forces and separate them from what they can do (reversal of the relation of forces, projection of a reactive image). It should be noted that the revolt of reactive forces would still not be a complete triumph without this second aspect of res sentiment.</mark> [Page 147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KB96UWRL)
- [N] Two aspects of ressentiment displacement and r3vrrsal by projection.

- [N] Bad conscience and ressentiment each have two aspects: a raw, psychological content and a moment where this content takes form.
- [N] Ressentiment's raw content (topological) is the displacement of reactive forces escaping active force, flooding consciousness with traces.
- [N] Ressentiment's form (typological) is the spirit of revenge and accusation, embodying the reactive type and reversing force relations through projection.
- [N] The second, formal aspect is necessary for the triumph of reactive forces.

> Ressentiment has a dual nature: a raw psychological content involving reactive forces escaping action and flooding consciousness with traces, and a formal, typological aspect where this content takes the form of the spirit of revenge and perpetual accusation, reversing force relations through projected fictions. The latter is crucial for its triumph.

### Fiction of Reactive Projection

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It presides over the whole evolution of ressentiment, that is to say, over the operations by which active force is, simultaneously, separated from what it can do (falsification), accused and treated as blameworthy (depreciation), and the corresÂ­ ponding values are reversed (negation).</mark> [Page 148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A683G5GX)
- [N] The fiction of the reactive projection, inverted image

- [N] The fictional projection inherent in ressentiment drives its development.
- [N] This fiction leads to the falsification/separation of active force from its capacity, its depreciation/accusation, and the reversal/negation of values.

> The progression of ressentiment is fueled by its underlying fiction, which systematically weakens, accuses, and negates active forces and their corresponding values.

### Active Force Turned Inward

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The objective of both forms of ressentiment is to deprive active force of its material conditions of operation, to keep it strictly separate from what it can do.</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U7XLKRHX)

<mark class="hltr-blue">. "All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward - that is what I call the internalisation of man . . . that is the origin of the 'bad conscience' " (GM II 16 pp. 84-5).</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPN2TRDI)

- [N] Both aspects of ressentiment aim to separate active force from its capacity.
- [N] When active force is thus deprived, it turns inward or against itself, becoming truly reactive.
- [N] Bad conscience originates from this internalization of instincts/active force that cannot discharge outwardly.

> The separation of active force from its capacity to act, facilitated by ressentiment, leads to its internalization and being turned against itself. This process is identified as the origin of bad conscience and the becoming-reactive of what was once active.

### Bad Conscience and False Love

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It hides its hatred under a tempting love: I who accuse you, it is for your own good; I love you in order that you will join me, until you are joined with me, until you yourself become a painful, sick, reactive being, a good being</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V8Z4TMLF)

- [N] Bad conscience (and ressentiment) can mask hatred with a manipulative "love" that seeks to make others sick and reactive ("good").

> Bad conscience can disguise its underlying hatred with a manipulative form of "love" that aims to assimilate others into its own state of reactive suffering.

### Bad Conscience Multiplies Pain

<mark class="hltr-orange">Bad conscience is the conscience that mulÂ­tiplies its pain, which has found a technique for manufacturing pain by turning active force back against itself: the squalid workshop.

<mark class="hltr-blue">"The passion of the most savage": pain is made the consequence of a fault and the means of a salvation; pain is healed by manufacturing yet more pain, by internalising it still further; one tries to forget, that is to say, one cures oneself of pain by infecting the wound (GM III 1 5 ).</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZDUXPM8H)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">tragedy dies at the same time as drama becomes an inward conflict and suffering is internalised.</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YSV3GYHQ)

- [N] The second aspect of bad conscience (typological) is the feeling of guilt, interpreting pain as consequence of fault and means of salvation.
- [N] Existence's meaning becomes tied to the meaning of pain.
- [N] Masters understand pain as giving pleasure to someone (inflicting or contemplating). Active men can bear their own pain by imagining it pleases someone else.
- [N] Reactive individuals attempt to cure pain by creating more pain (internalizing it), infecting the wound instead of healing.
- [N] Tragedy declines when conflict becomes internalized and suffering is internalized.

> Bad conscience, in its form as guilt, interprets pain as punishment and a path to salvation. This stands in contrast to the master's perspective, which sees pain as a source of pleasure for the one inflicting or observing it. Reactive responses to pain intensify suffering through internalization, contributing to the shift from external tragedy to internal drama.

### Priest Changes Direction of Ressentiment to Create Guilt

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the man of ressentiment, who is by nature full of pain, is looking for a cause for his suffering. He accuses, he accuses everything that is active in life.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4UWRXXFR)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is in bad conscience that ressentiment comes into its own and reaches the summit of its contï¿½gious power: by changing direction. It cries "It is my fault, it is my fault" until the whole world takes up this dreary refrain, until everything active in life develops this same feeling of guilt.</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EV8Y7CDA)

<mark class="hltr-orange">The definition of the first aspect of the bad conscience was: the multiplication of pain by the internalisation of force . The definition of the second aspect is: the internalisation of pain by the change of direction of ressentiment.</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7H2TYUFT)

- [N] The man of ressentiment seeks a cause for his pain and accuses external active forces.
- [N] Bad conscience is the state where ressentiment changes direction, internalizing blame ("It is my fault").
- [N] This redirection makes bad conscience contagious, spreading guilt to all active life.
- [N] The two aspects of bad conscience are pain multiplication (internalized force) and pain internalization (redirection of ressentiment).

> The Christian priest facilitates the development of bad conscience by redirecting the ressentiment-fueled search for blame from external active forces inward. This internalization of blame as guilt ("It is my fault") allows bad conscience to become contagious and reach its full power.

### Culture as Training and Selection

<mark class="hltr-orange">Culture means training and selection. Nietzsche calls the movement of culture the "morality of customs" (D9);</mark> [Page 156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3AFXPKAQ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) That which is obeyed, in a people, race or class, is always historical, arbitrary, grotesque, stupid and limited; this usually represents the worst reactive forces. 2) But in the fact that something, no matter what it is, is obeyed, appears a principle which goes beyond peoples, races and classes. To obey the law because it is the law: the form of the law means that a certain activity, a certain active force, is exercised on man and is given the task of training him.</mark> [Page 156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EP7A76Y8)
- [N] Two elements of culture (violent training)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Every historical law is arbitrary, but what is not arbitrary, what is prehistoric and generic , is the law of obeying laws.</mark> [Page 156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JPZ4XBBI)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The activity of culture is, in principle, exercised on reactive forces, it gives them habits and imposes models on them in order to make them suitable for being acted.</mark> [Page 157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WNA34K52)

- [N] Culture is defined as training and selection ("morality of customs").
- [N] It has two elements: the arbitrary content of laws (often representing reactive forces) and the non-arbitrary principle of obeying law itself (an active force training man).
- [N] Culture's activity primarily targets reactive forces to make them capable of being acted upon.
- [N] A key goal is strengthening consciousness.

> From a prehistoric perspective, culture is understood as a process of training and selection (morality of customs). Despite the arbitrary content of specific laws, the act of obeying the law itself represents an active force that trains reactive forces and strengthens consciousness.

### The Sovereign Individual and the Faculty of Promising

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is precisely the selective object of culture: forming a man capable of promising and thus of making use of the future, a free and powerful man. Only such a man is active; he acts his reactions, everything in him is active or acted. The faculty of promising is the effect of culture as the activity of man on man; the man who can promise is the product of culture as species activity .</mark> [Page 157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I6ZE3YGZ)
- [N] Faculty of promising, commitment to the future, memory of the future self

- [N] The selective goal of culture is to form the "sovereign individual" capable of promising and using the future.
- [N] This man is active, acting his reactions, and everything in him is active or acted.
- [N] The faculty of promising is the product of culture as species activity.

> The selective purpose of culture is to produce the "sovereign individual" capable of making promises, who is fully active and able to shape the future. This capacity for promising is a key outcome of culture as a species-level activity.

### Justice and Punishment in Culture

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Culture has always used the following means: it made pain a medium of exchange, a currency, an equivalent; precisely the exact equivalent of a forgetting, of an inquiry caused, a promise not kept (GM II 4). Culture, when related to this means, is calledjustice ; the means itself is called punishment. "Injury caused = pain undergone" - this is the equation of punishment</mark> [Page 157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USA2H7Y9)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) Culture as prehistoric or generic activity, an enterprise of training and selection; 2) The means used by this activity, the equation of punishment, the relationship of debt, the responsible man; 3) The product of this activity: the active man, free and powerful, the man who can promise .</mark> [Page 158](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REFDDL59)

- [N] Culture uses pain as a means of exchange/equivalent (e.g., for forgetting or breaking promises).
- [N] This means is called justice, and punishment embodies the equation "injury caused = pain undergone."
- [N] Justice establishes a creditor-debtor relationship, making man responsible for a debt.
- [N] Summary of elements: culture as training/selection, means (punishment/debt), product (sovereign, promising man).

> Culture employs mechanisms like justice and punishment, which utilize pain as a form of exchange to enforce responsibility and create the capacity for promising by establishing a creditor-debtor relationship.

### Sovereign Individual Beyond Morality of Customs

<mark class="hltr-yellow">However we consider culture or justice we always see in them the exercise of a formative activity, the opposite of ressentiment and bad conscience.</mark> [Page 159](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y632E77M)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The product of culture is not the man who obeys the law, but the sovereign and legislative individual who defmes himself by power over himself, over destiny, over the law: the free, the light, the irresponsible .</mark> [Page 160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5YDIG9Z9)

- [N] Culture/justice is a formative activity, opposite of ressentiment/bad conscience.
- [N] The ultimate product of culture is the sovereign individual, liberated from the morality of customs, autonomous, and supramoral.
- [N] This individual has power over self, destiny, and the law; they are free, light, and irresponsible (in the positive sense).
- [N] The autonomous individual is master of justice and their reactive forces, becoming author and actor rather than merely answering to authority.

> From a post-historic viewpoint, the culmination of culture's formative activity is the sovereign individual. This autonomous figure transcends the morality of customs and external law, embodying freedom, lightness, and positive irresponsibility, asserting mastery over self and destiny.

### Means Disappearing in the Product

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is the general movement of culture: the means disappearing in the product. Responsibility as responsibility before the law, law as the law of justice, justice as the means of culture - all this disappears in the product of culture itself. The morality of customs, the spirit of the laws, produces the man emancipated from the law.</mark> [Page 160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/828JQ9G2)

- [N] Culture's process involves the means (law, responsibility, justice) disappearing into the product (the emancipated individual).
- [N] The system of customs/laws ultimately produces a man who transcends those laws.

> The developmental logic of culture leads to its means becoming obsolete in its product: the individual formed by law and responsibility ultimately transcends them, becoming emancipated from the very framework that shaped them.

<mark class="hltr-purple">13. Culture Considered from the Historical Point of View</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/438F7RSQ)

### History as Perversion of Culture by Reactive Forces

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We must say of culture both that it diappeared long ago and that it has not yet begun. Species activity disappears into the night of the past as its product does into the night of the future.</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NGM9AGJ9)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">history is this very perversion, it is identical to the "degeneration of culture" . - Instead of species activity, history presents us with races, peoples, classes, Churches and States. Onto species activity are grafted social organisations, associations, communities of a reactive character, parasites which cover it over and absorb it. By means of species activity - the movement of which they falsify - reactive forces form collectivities, what Nietzsche calls "herds" (GM III 1 8).</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G8IH59TL)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">history presents us with societies which have no wish to perish and which cannot imagine anything superior to their own laws.</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JY6BDJBU)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Instead of the sovereign individual as the product of culture, history presents us with its own product, the domesticated man in whom it finds the famous meaning of history: "the sublime abortion", "the gregarious animal, docile, sickly, mediocre being, the European today" (BGE 62 . GM I 1 1). - History presents all the violence of culture as the legitimate property of peoples, States and Churches, as the manifestaÂ­tion of their force.</mark> [Page 161](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YCUM8AZH)

- [N] Culture exists in a temporal paradox: both past (species activity) and future (sovereign individual).
- [N] History is the *perversion* or "degeneration" of culture.
- [N] Reactive forces (herds, states, churches) parasitically graft onto and falsify species activity.
- [N] Historical societies resist change and cannot conceive of anything beyond their own reactive laws.
- [N] History's product is the domesticated, mediocre "last man," not the sovereign individual.
- [N] History misrepresents the violence of culture as the legitimate force of reactive institutions.

> From a historical perspective, culture appears as a perverted or degenerated process. Reactive forces (states, churches, herds) hijack and falsify the inherent activity of culture, producing the domesticated, mediocre "last man" instead of the sovereign individual, and presenting their own reactive dominance as legitimate force.

### History Selects for the Weak

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Selection becomes the opposite of what it was from the standpoint of activity, it is now only a means of preserving, organising and propagating the reactive life (GM III 1 3-20 BGE 62).</mark> [Page 162](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NHWMLL8T)

- [N] In history, selection is inverted, serving only to preserve, organize, and spread reactive life, not to foster active life.

> Historical selection is the inverse of active selection; it functions to perpetuate and organize reactive forms of life.

### Triumph of Reactive Forces as Principle of Universal History

<mark class="hltr-yellow">History thus appears as the act by which reactive forces take possession of culture or divert its course in their favour . The triumph of reactive forces is not an accident in history but the principle and meaning of "universal history" .</mark> [Page 162](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVRVLEGF)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Culture is inseparable from the history of the movement which perverts it and puts it at the service of reactive forces; but culture is also inseparable from history itself.</mark> [Page 163](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JW2UNMV7)

<mark class="hltr-magenta">man is essentially reactive; there is nevertheless a species activity of man, but one that is necesÂ­sarily deformed, necessarily missing its goal, leading to the domestiÂ­cated man; this activity must be taken up again on another plane, the plane on which it produces, but produces something other than man</mark> [Page 163](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7NA3EEKC)
- [N] Although man is essentially reactive, there is a species activity that is deformed by history, leading to the domesticated man. This activity needs to be re-engaged on a different level to produce something beyond man itself.

- [N] History's principle and meaning is the triumph of reactive forces taking over culture.
- [N] Culture and the history of its perversion by reactive forces are intertwined.
- [N] Man is essentially reactive, and species activity, though present, is deformed by history, leading to the domesticated man. This activity must be renewed on a new plane to create something beyond man.

> The historical narrative, particularly "universal history," is defined by the systematic triumph and perversion of culture by reactive forces. Despite man's reactive nature, there is a species activity that history distorts, necessitating a re-engagement on a different level to create something other than domesticated man.

### Bad Conscience, Responsibility, Guilt

<mark class="hltr-purple">14. Bad Conscience, Responsibility, Guilt</mark> [Page 164](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ILD2BQRV)

### Mechanisms of Bad Conscience and Guilt

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We said: the priest is the one who internalises pain by changing the direction ofressentiment; in this way he gives bad conscience form. We asked: how can ressentiment change direction whilst keeping its properties of hate and revenge?</mark> [Page 165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VPRSIIFY)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) Under the cover of species activity and by usurping this activity, reactive forces constitute associations (herds). Certain reactive forces appear to act, others serve as material</mark> [Page 165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2XEBBWBA)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) It is in this milieu that bad conscience is formed. Abstracted from species activity, debt is projected into reactive association. Debt becomes the relation of a debtor who will never fmish paying to a creditor who will never fmish using up the interest on the debt: " Debt toward the divinity" .</mark> [Page 165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5J72RQ2)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) But the priest does not only corrupt the herd, he organises it, he protects it. He invents the means which enable us to endure multipÂ­ lied, internalised pain.</mark> [Page 165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M6273TJD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">4) It will be noted in all this that the form of bad conscience, just like the form ofressentiment, implies a fiction. Bad conscience rests on the diverting of species activity, on the usurping of this activity, on the projection of debt.</mark> [Page 166](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5VMW4479)

- [N] The priest internalizes pain by redirecting ressentiment, giving form to bad conscience.
- [N] Ressentiment changes direction (from external to internal blame) while retaining hate/revenge.
- [N] Reactive forces usurp species activity to form "herds."
- [N] Bad conscience is formed in this context, projecting debt into a reactive association (debt towards divinity).
- [N] The priest organizes/protects the herd and creates means to endure internalized pain.
- [N] Bad conscience relies on the fiction of diverting species activity, usurping it, and projecting debt.

> The priest, by redirecting ressentiment inward, shapes bad conscience. This involves reactive forces usurping species activity, projecting the concept of debt onto a divine creditor, and creating mechanisms to manage internalized pain. Bad conscience, like ressentiment, is based on fictions that distort genuine activity and responsibility.

### Ascetic Ideal: Triumph of Reactive Forces and Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-orange">In its initial sense the ascetic ideal designates the complex of ressentiment and bad conscience: it crosses the one with the other, it reinforces the one with the other . Secondly, it expresses all the ways in which the sickness of ressentiment, the suffering of bad conscience become livable , or rather, are organised and propagated; the ascetic priest is simultaneously gardener, breeder, shepherd and doctor. Finally, and this is its deepest sense, the ascetic ideal expresses the will which makes reactive forces triumph.</mark> [Page 167](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHUNNMLU)
- [N] Ascetic Ideal

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The fiction of a world-beyond in the ascetic ideal: this is what accompanies the steps ofressentiment and bad conscience, this is what permits the depreciation of life and all that is active in it, this is what gives the world a value of appearance or of nought.</mark> [Page 168](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYIBRE8X)

<mark class="hltr-orange">The sense of the ascetic ideal is thus as follows: to express the affinity of reactive forces with nihilism, to express nihilism as the "motor" of reactive forces.</mark> [Page 168](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MZ2NVJNR)

- [N] The ascetic ideal combines ressentiment and bad conscience, organizing and propagating their suffering.
- [N] The ascetic priest acts as a figure who manages and spreads this reactive sickness.
- [N] The deepest sense of the ascetic ideal is the will that brings about the triumph of reactive forces.
- [N] It relies on the fiction of a world-beyond to depreciate life and the active.
- [N] The ascetic ideal expresses the inherent link between reactive forces and nihilism, where nihilism is the driving force for these reactive tendencies.

> The ascetic ideal is the ultimate expression of reactive forces, combining ressentiment and bad conscience and providing mechanisms for their propagation. Its deepest meaning is the will that causes reactive forces to triumph, relying on the fiction of a transcendent realm to devalue earthly, active life and embodying the affinity between reactive forces and nihilism.

<mark class="hltr-purple">1. Nihilism</mark> [Page 170](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8MY2BIHB)

### Nihilism as Will to Nothingness

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The idea of another world, of a supersensible world in all its forms (God, essence, the good, truth), the idea of values superior to life, is not one example among many but the constitutive element of all fiction.</mark> [Page 170](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HRC5EWUH)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is not the will that denies itself in higher values, it is higher values that are related to a will to deny, to annihilate life. "Nothingness of the will" : this Schopenhauerian concept is only a symptom; it means primarily a will to annihilation, a will to nothingness ... "but it is and always remains a will!" (GM III 28 p. 163).</mark> [Page 170](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I5SQWZYQ)

<mark class="hltr-orange">Nihil in "nihilism" means negation as quality of the will to power. Thus, in its primary and basic sense, nihilism signifies the value of nil taken on by life, the fiction of higher values which give it this value and the will to nothingness which is expressed in these higher values.</mark> [Page 170](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XCR4GMNM)

- [N] The idea of a transcendent world/values is the core element of all fiction that depreciates life.
- [N] Higher values are expressions of a will to deny/annihilate life (will to nothingness).
- [N] Nihilism's primary sense is the negation quality of will to power, giving life value nil, using fiction of higher values, and expressing will to nothingness.

> Nihilism is fundamentally linked to the fiction of a transcendent world and values superior to life. This fiction expresses a "will to nothingness," which is identified as the primary sense of nihilism â€“ a mode of will to power defined by negation that devalues life.

### Negative, Reactive, and Passive Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-orange">Previously life was depreciÂ­ated from the height of higher values, it was denied in the name of these values. Here, on the contrary, only life remains, but it is still a depreciated life which now continues in a world without values, stripped of meaning and purpose, sliding ever further towards its nothingness. Previously essence was opposed to appearance , life was turned into an appearance . Now essence is denied but appearance is retained: everything is merely appearance, life which is left to us remains for itself an appearance . The first sense of nihilism found its principle in the will to deny as will to power . The second sense , "the pessimism of weakness", fmds its principle in the reactive life comÂ­ pletely solitary and naked, in reactive forces reduced to themselves. The first sense is a negative nihilism; the second sense a reactive nihilism .</mark> [Page 171](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIEMKJD4)
- [N] Senses of nihilism

- [N] Negative nihilism: Life depreciated from the perspective of higher values (will to deny as will to power).
- [N] Reactive nihilism ("pessimism of weakness"): Higher values are gone, but life remains depreciated, becoming mere appearance in a meaningless world (reactive forces reduced to themselves).
- [N] Passive nihilism: Not explicitly defined here but is implied as a further stage of exhaustion.

> Nihilism is described in different forms: negative nihilism devalues life based on transcendent values; reactive nihilism retains a devalued life after the loss of transcendent values; passive nihilism is implied as a state of exhaustion preferring non-willing. These stages are driven by variations in reactive forces and the will to nothingness.

<mark class="hltr-orange">What is pity? It is this tolerance for states of life dose to zero.</mark> [Page 172](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZBSKFC4M)

<mark class="hltr-blue">"Pity is practical nihilism . . . pity persuades to nothingness! . . . One does not say 'nothingness": one says 'the Beyond'; or 'God' ; or 'true life'; or Nirvana, redemption, blessedness . . .

- [N] Pity is defined as tolerance for life states near zero, i.e., weak or suffering states.
- [N] Pity is "practical nihilism" because it persuades towards nothingness by valuing weakness and suffering, disguising itself with positive terms ("the Beyond," "God," etc.).
- [N] Pity is ultimately a tendency hostile to life.

> Pity is identified as a form of "practical nihilism" because it tolerates and validates weak, suffering states of life. By disguising a fundamental hostility to life with seemingly positive religious and moral language, it ultimately persuades towards a denial of robust existence.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">it is always the same type oflife which benefits from the depreciation of the whole of life in the first place, the type of life which took advantage of the will to nothingness in order to obtain its victory, the type of life which triumphed in the temples of God, in the shadow of higher values. Then, secondly, the type of life which puts itself in God's place, which turns against the principle of its own triumph and no longer recognises values other than its own. Finally, the exhausted life which prefers to not will, to fade away passively, rather than being animated by a will which goes beyond it. This still is and always remains the same type of life; life depreciated, reduced to its reactive form.</mark> [Page 174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ADUKIFPP)

- [N] nihilism is not an event in history but the motor of the history of man as universal history. Negative, reactive and passive nihilism: for Nietzsche one and the same history is marked out by Judaism, ChristÂ­ianity, the reformation, free thought, democratic and socialist ideolÂ­ogy etc . Up until the last man.

- [N] Nihilism progresses through stages: negative, reactive, and passive, marking a historical trajectory from God to the "last man."
- [N] The same type of depreciated, reactive life benefits and perpetuates itself throughout these stages, initially under God/higher values, then replacing God, and finally in a state of passive exhaustion ("not willing").
- [N] Nihilism acts as the engine driving the entire course of "universal history," from Judaism to the last man, via various reactive ideologies.

> Nihilism progresses through stages (negative, reactive, passive) and is the driving force of "universal history," perpetually manifesting the same type of depreciated, reactive life that ultimately leads to the exhausted state of the "last man."

### Stages of God's Death (Nihilism's History)

<mark class="hltr-purple">1 )From the point of view of negative nihilism: the moment of the Judaic and Christian consciousness.</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6QBN72WI)

<mark class="hltr-blue">"If one shifts the centre of gravity of life out of life into the 'Beyond' - into nothingness - one has deprived life as such of its centre of gravity" (AC 43 p. 1 5 5).</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LT2HR6BD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Judaic consciousness of the consciousness of ressentiment (after the golden age of the kings of Isreal) presents these two aspects: the universal appears as a hatred for life, the particular as a love of life - provided that it is sick and reactive</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z7N6AJAD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The will to nothingness must be made more seductive by opposing one aspect to the other, by making love an antithesis of hate. The Jewish God puts his son to death to make him independent of himself and of the Jewish people .</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BH4CX3EQ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">This is the second sense of the death of God: the Father dies, the Son creates another God for us. The Son asks only that we believe in him, that we love him as he loves us, that we become reactive in order to avoid hate .</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPGW7VN7)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Third sense of the death of God: St Paul seizes hold of this death</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VBVKCD7W)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Christ is said to have died for our sins !</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK6584JQ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">God put his son on the cross out of love; we respond to this love to the extent that we feel guilty, guilty of this death, and we redress it by accusing ourselves, by paying interest on the debt. Through the love of God, through the sacrifice of his son, the whole of life becomes reactive. - Life dies but it is reborn as reactive .</mark> [Page 176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NGGYYE9C)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">St Paul's other falsification, the resurrection of Christ and the afterlife for us, the unity of love and the reactive life.</mark> [Page 177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6FESEPIM)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is no longer the father who kills the son, it is no longer the son who kills the father: the father dies in the son, the son is resurrected in the father, for us, because of us.

St Paul could make no use at all of the redeemer's life - he needed the death on the Cross and something in addition" : the resurrection.</mark> [Page 177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9ZIRMR3H)

- [N] Stage 1 (Negative Nihilism/Judaic-Christian): Life's center of gravity is shifted to a "Beyond." Judaic consciousness embodies ressentiment (universal hatred for life, love for sick/reactive life). Jewish God kills the son to make will to nothingness seductive.
- [N] Stage 2 (Second sense of God's death): The Son creates another God; emphasis on love and becoming reactive to avoid hate.
- [N] Stage 3 (Third sense of God's death): St. Paul's interpretation - Christ died for sins, leading to guilt and making life reactive through debt/accusation. Resurrection unifies love and reactive life.

> The death of God is traced through stages corresponding to forms of nihilism. It begins with shifting life's value to a transcendent realm (negative nihilism, Judaic/Christian consciousness). It progresses through the son creating a God based on love and reactivity, and finally through St. Paul's interpretation of Christ's death for sins, which internalizes guilt and makes life reactive through debt, ultimately leading to a reactive rebirth.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Man killed God, but which man killed God? The reactive man, "the ugliest of men". The divine will, the will to nothingness, can not tolerate any other life but the reactive one and this no longer even tolerates God, it cannot bear God's pity, it takes his sacrifice literally, it suffocates him in the trap of his mercy.

- [N] Stage 4 (Fourth sense of God's death/Reactive Nihilism/European consciousness): God is killed by the reactive man ("ugliest of men").
- [N] The reactive will to nothingness, tolerating only reactive life, cannot bear God's pity and suffocates him through his own mercy/sacrifice.

> From the perspective of reactive nihilism (European consciousness), God is killed by the reactive man, who, embodying the will to nothingness, cannot tolerate even God's pity and effectively suffocates the divine through its own excessive mercy towards reactive life.

### Passive Nihilism: Buddhism and the True Christ

<mark class="hltr-purple">3) From the point of view of passive nihilism: the moment of Buddhist consciousness.</mark> [Page 177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPP7XELJ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the true Christ is as follows; the glad tidings that he brings, the suppression of the idea of sin, the absence of all ressentiment and of all spirit of revenge, the consequent refusal of all war, the revelation of a kingdom of God on Earth as state of the heart and above all the acceptance of death as the proof of his doctrine .</mark> [Page 178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E3IYZC5)
- [N] The true Christ was a kind of Buddha

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Beyond bad conscience and ressentiment Jesus gave the reactive man a lesson: he taught him to die.</mark> [Page 178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UXPN56JQ)

<mark class="hltr-blue">Buddhism is the religion of passive nihilism, "Buddhism is a religion for the end and fatigue of a civilisation; Christianity does not even find civilizaÂ­tion in existence - it establishes civilization if need be" (AC 22 p. 1 32).</mark> [Page 178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S3YC9XQE)
- [N] [[Buddhism\|Buddhism]]
- [N] The "true Christ" is seen as analogous to Buddha: bringing glad tidings, suppressing sin/ressentiment/revenge, revealing a kingdom of God within (state of the heart), and accepting death.
- [N] Jesus taught reactive man how to die (transcend suffering/reactivity).
- [N] Buddhism is presented as the religion of passive nihilism, arising

> Buddhism represents passive nihilism, characteristic of the end and fatigue of a civilization, whereas Christianity is depicted as establishing civilization. Jesus, in his true form, is seen as teaching the reactive man how to transcend himself by accepting death, aligning with a form of passive detachment akin to Buddhism.

### Dialectic Misinterprets Sense, Essence, and Change

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The dialectic does not even skim the surface of interpretation, it never goes beyond the domain of symptoms. It confuses interpretation with the development of the uninterpreted symbol. This is why, in questions of change and development, it conceives of nothing deeper than an abstract permutation where the subject becomes predicate and the predicate, subject.</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FQ7GPJN2)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Opposition can be the law of the relation between abstract products, but difference is the only principle of genesis or production; a principle which itself proÂ­duces opposition as mere appearance. Dialectic thrives on oppositions because it is unaware of far more subtle and subterranean differential mechanisms: topological displacements, typological variations.</mark> [Page 180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65EYLW6J)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Considering symptoms abstractly, making the movement of appearance into the genetic law of things and retaining only an inverted image of principle - the whole dialectic operates and moves in the element of[ution .</mark> [Page 181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/INGCPDPD)

<mark class="hltr-green">Nietzsche's work is directed against the dialectic for three reasons: it misinterprets sense because it does not know the nature of the forces which concretely appropriate phenomena; it misinterprets essence because it does not know the real element from which forces, their qualities and their relations derive; it misinterprets change and transformation because it is content to work with permutations of abstract and unreal terms.</mark> [Page 181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHTIDHED)
- [N] Against the dialectic

- [N] The dialectic operates superficially, mistaking symptom development for interpretation.
- [N] It relies on abstract permutations (subject-predicate shifts) for change, missing deeper processes.
- [N] Dialectic confuses opposition (abstract products) with difference (principle of genesis).
- [N] It is unaware of subtle differential mechanisms like topological and typological shifts.
- [N] The dialectic's errors: misinterpreting sense (lacks understanding of forces), misinterpreting essence (lacks understanding of will to power/differential element), and misinterpreting change (uses abstract terms).

> Nietzsche fundamentally opposes the dialectic, arguing that it fails to grasp the true nature of things. It misinterprets sense by ignoring the forces at play, misunderstands essence by failing to recognize the differential element of will to power, and distorts change by relying on abstract oppositions rather than the dynamic principle of difference.

### Dialectic as Christian Ideology of Ressentiment

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is reactive forces that express themselves in opposition, the will to nothingness that expresses itself in the labour of the negative . The dialectic is the natural ideology of ressentiment and bad conscience. It is thought in the perspective of nihilism and from the standpoint of reactive forces. It is a fundamentally Christian way of thinking, from one end to the other; powerless to create new ways of thinking and feeling. The death of God is a grand, noisy, dialectical event; but an event which happens in the din of reactive forces and the fumes of nihilism.</mark> [Page 182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XTC577K5)

- [N] Opposition in dialectics expresses reactive forces, and the "labour of the negative" expresses the will to nothingness.
- [N] Dialectic is the natural ideology of ressentiment and bad conscience, rooted in nihilism and reactive forces.
- [N] It is fundamentally Christian thought, incapable of creating new perspectives.
- [N] The dialectical death of God is a superficial event amidst reactive forces and nihilism.

> The dialectic is exposed as the inherent ideology of ressentiment and bad conscience, deeply rooted in nihilism and reactive forces. It is seen as a fundamentally Christian mode of thought, unable to generate genuinely new perspectives and reducing even significant events like the death of God to the level of reactive noise.

### The Dialectic's Practical Motor: Alienation and Reappropriation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the posing of the question "who?" is suffiÂ­cient to lead the dialectic to its true result: saltus mortalis.</mark> [Page 183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MKKRGU3U)
- [N] Saltus Mortalis - leap of death

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The speculative motor of the dialectic is contradiction and its resolution. But its practical motor is alienation and the suppression of alienation, alienation and reappropriation.</mark> [Page 183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZL8Q6PAW)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Overcoming alienation thus means pure, cold annihilaÂ­tion, a recovery which lets nothing which it recovers subsist: "it is not that the ego is all, but the ego destroys all" (Stirner p. 1 82).</mark> [Page 184](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LRU855CV)
- [N] Ego

- [N] The question "who?" reveals the dialectic's "leap of death" (inability to answer).
- [N] The practical engine of dialectics is alienation and reappropriation (suppression of alienation).
- [N] Overcoming alienation in this framework can mean annihilation, where nothing truly survives the process.

> While dialectics is driven speculatively by contradiction, its practical engine is alienation and reappropriation. However, when faced with the question of "who," this process can lead to a destructive outcome where overcoming alienation results in annihilation rather than genuine transformation.

### Nihilism as the Truth of the Dialectic

<mark class="hltr-yellow">History in general and HegelianÂ­ism in particular found their outcome, but also their most complete dissolution, in a triumphant nihilism. Dialectic loves and controls history, but it has a history itself which it suffers from and which it does not control. The meaning of history and the dialectic together is not the realisation of reason, freedom or man as species, but nihilism, nothing but nihilism. Stirner is the dialectician who reveals nihilism as the truth of the dialectic .</mark> [Page 184](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RKBPVPBT)
- [N] Nihilism is the truth of the dialectic

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Marx elaborates his famous doctrine of the conditioned ego: the species and the individual, species being and the particular, social order and egoism are reconciled in the ego conditioned by social and historical relations. Is this sufficient? What is the species and which one is the individual?</mark> [Page 185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PLQYDYYQ)
- [N] Marx on conditioned ego

- [N] The outcome of history and Hegelianism is not progress (reason, freedom) but triumphant nihilism.
- [N] Nihilism is presented as the ultimate truth revealed by dialectics.
- [N] Stirner is seen as the figure who exposes this truth.
- [N] Marx's concept of the conditioned ego, while attempting reconciliation, still faces Nietzsche's fundamental question "which one?" regarding the species and individual.

> The historical trajectory and Hegelian philosophy are interpreted as culminating not in progress but in triumphant nihilism. Nihilism is identified as the underlying truth of the dialectic, exposed by figures like Stirner. Even Marxist attempts at reconciliation (conditioned ego) remain within a framework that ultimately fails to address Nietzsche's question of "who."

### Nietzsche and the Dialectic

<mark class="hltr-purple">6. Nietzsche and the Dialectic</mark> [Page 185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YD8IJKWW)

### Nietzsche's Critique of German Philosophy and the Dialectic

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nietzsche never stops attacking the theological and Christian character of German philosophy (the "Tubingen seminary") - the powerlessness of this philosophy to extricate itself from the nihilistic perspective (Hegel's negative nihilism, Feuerbach's reactive nihilism, Stirner's extreme nihilism) - the incapacity of this philosophy to end in anything but the ego, man or phantasms of the human (the Nietzschean overman against the dialectic) - the mystifYing character of so-called dialectical transformaÂ­ tions (transvaluation against reappropriation and abstract permutaÂ­tions).</mark> [Page 185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8MSX46HD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">He makes use of the question "which one?" but only in order to dissolve the dialectic in the nothingness of the ego . He is incapable of posing this question in anything but the human perspecÂ­tive , under any conditions but those of nihilism. He cannot let this question develop for itself or pose it in another element which would give it an afftrmative response.</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z4DQFAJ5)
- [N] Stirner was close, but the dialectician in him carried him to nihilism.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Overcoming is opposed to preserving but also to appropriating and reappropriating. Transvaluing is opposed to current values but also to dialectical pseudo-transformations</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WX5CQ2HW)
- [N] Overcoming and transvaluation

- [N] Nietzsche critiques German philosophy's (incl. dialectics) theological/Christian nature, its entrapment in nihilism (negative, reactive, extreme forms), its focus on the ego/man, and the superficiality of its "transformations."
- [N] Stirner used the "which one?" question but only to dissolve dialectics into the nihilism of the ego, remaining limited to the human/nihilistic perspective.
- [N] Nietzsche's concepts of overcoming and transvaluation are contrasted with dialectical preservation, reappropriation, and pseudo-transformations.

> Nietzsche wages a multifaceted critique against German philosophy and the dialectic, exposing its Christian roots, inescapable nihilism, anthropocentric focus (ego, man), and the false nature of its transformations. Even thinkers like Stirner, who approach the "which one?" question, remain trapped in the human/nihilistic perspective, failing to achieve the true overcoming and transvaluation Nietzsche advocates.

### The Overman as a New Type

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Neither ego nor man is unique</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BUQCLI5)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The overman is defined by a new way of feeling: he is a different subject from man, something other than the human type . A new way of thinking, predicates other than divine ones; for the divine is still a way of preserving man and of preserving the essential characÂ­teristic of God, God as attribute . A new way of evaluating: not a change of values, not an abstract transposition nor a dialectical reversal, but a change and reversal in the element from which the value of values derives, a "transvaluation" .</mark> [Page 186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3QSNHUX)

<mark class="hltr-blue">The cry of the higher man is manifold: "It was a strange, protracted, manifold cry, however, and Zarathustra clearly distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although, heard from a distance, it might sound like a cry from a single throat"</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQSY7TLZ)

- [N] Neither the ego nor man is unique; the Overman represents a fundamentally different type/subject.
- [N] The Overman is defined by a new sensibility/way of feeling.
- [N] The Overman involves a new way of thinking (beyond divine predicates, which preserve man/God attributes).
- [N] The Overman embodies a "transvaluation" - a change in the very element from which value derives, not just a shift in values.
- [N] The "cry of the higher man" is manifold, distinct from the unified voice of the Overman (this quote seems to refer to the *higher man*, not necessarily the Overman yet).

> The Overman is a radically different type of being, defined by a new way of feeling, thinking (beyond theological/human categories), and evaluating (transvaluation). This figure transcends the limitations of the ego and conventional humanity.

### Characters of the Higher Man

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The characters which make up the higher man are: the prophet, the two kings, the man with the leeches, the sorcerer, the last pope, the ugliest man, the voluntary beggar and the shadow.</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDQR4W8W)
- [N] #ðŸ’¡ descriptions of each are detailed in this section, could be some fantastic character ideas in here

<mark class="hltr-orange">The higher man is the image in which the reactive man represents himself as "higher" , and, better still, deifies himself. At the same time, the higher man is the image in which the product of culture or species activity appears.</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSKBZPJB)
- [N] The higher man

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The prophet is the prophet of great weariÂ­ness, representative of passive nihilism, prophet of the last man . He is looking for a sea to drink, a sea in which to drown himself; but every death seems to him still too active, we are too tired to die . He wills death but as a passive extinction (Z II "The Prophet", IV "The Cry of Distress").</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PUZ7I9NW)
- [N] The Prophet

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The sorcerer is the bad conscience, the "counterfeiter" , the "penitent of the spirit" , the "demon of melancholy" who fabricates his suffering in order to excite pity, in order to spread the contagion.</mark> [Page 187](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2MBEHMGS)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">"You would deck out even your disease if you showed yourself naked to your physician" : the sorcerer fakes pain, he invents a new sense for it, he betrays Dionysus, he seizes hold of Ariadne's song, he, the falsely tragic one (Z IV "The Sorcerer").</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GGBKEUT6)
- [N] The Sorcerer

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The ugliest of men represents reactive nihilism: the reactive man has turned his ressentiment against God, he has put himself in the place of the God that he has killed, but he does not stop being reactive, full of bad conscience and ressentiment (Z IV "The Ugliest of Men").</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M6SUQJ77)
- [N] The Ugliest of Men

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The two kings are customs, the morality of customs and the two ends of this morality, the two extremities of culture . They represent species activity grasped in the prehistoric principle of determination of customs but also in the post-historic product where customs are suppressed. They lose hope because they witness the triumph of a "mob" : they see forces being grafted onto the customs themselves which distort species activity and deform both its principle and its product (Z IV "Conversation with the Kings").</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/569D3GVN)
- [N] Then Two Kings

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The man with leeches represents the product of culture as science . He is the "conscientious man of the spirit" . He wanted certainty and to appropriate science and culture . "Better to know nothing than to half-know many things" (Z IV "The Leech" p. 263). And through this striving for certainty he learns that science is not even an objective knowledge of the leech and of its primary causes, but only a knowledge of the leech's "brain", knowledge which is no longer knowledge because it must identify itself with the leech, think like it and surrender itself to it. Knowledge is life against life, the life which cuts into life, but only the leech cut into life, it alone is knowledge (Z IV "The Leech" - the importance of the brain in Schopenhauer's theories will also be recalled).</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ALHNVSSU)
- [N] The Man with Leeches

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The last pope has turned his existence into a long service. He represents the product of culture as religion. He served God until the end and in doing so lost an eye . The lost eye is undoubtedly the eye which saw active, affirmative gods. The remaining eye followed the Jewish and Christian god through the whole of his history: he saw nothingness, the whole of negative nihilism and the replacement of God by man. The old lackey who depairs because he has lost his master: "I am without master and nevertheless I am not free; neither am I merry except in memories" (Z IV "Retired from Service").</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YSF7JRQH)
- [N] The Last Pope

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The voluntary beggar has gone through the whole human species, from rich to poor. He was seeking the "kingdom of heaven" , "happiness on earth", as a recompense but also as the product of human, species and cultural</mark> [Page 188](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2FJTE6H)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">activity. He wanted to know who this kingdom belonged to and what this activity represented; Science, morality or religion? Or something else again, poverty or work? But the kingdom of heaven is no more among the poor than among the rich: everywhere there is the mob, "mob above, mob below"! The voluntary beggar found the kingdom of heaven to be the only recompense and the true product of a species activity: but only among cows, only in the species activity of cows. For cows know how to ruminate and rumination is the product of culture as culture (Z IV "The Voluntary Beggar").</mark> [Page 189](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8M63ZRJE)
- [N] The Voluntary Beggar

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The shadow is the wanÂ­derer himself, species activity itself, culture and its movement. The meaning of the wanderer and of his shadow is that only the shadow wanders. The wandering shadow is species activity, but only insofar as it loses its product and its principle and hunts for them desperately (Z IV "The Shadow"). - The two kings are the guardians of species activity, the man with leeches is the product of this activity as science, the last pope is the product of this activity as religion; the voluntary beggar, beyond science and religion, wants to know what the adequÂ­ate product of this activity is; the shadow is this activity itself insofar as it loses its aim and searches for its principle</mark> [Page 189](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZD72C4RY)

- [N] The "higher man" is a figure where reactive man sees himself as superior or deified; also represents the product of culture/species activity.
- [N] Characters representing the higher man: Prophet (passive nihilism, last man), Sorcerer (bad conscience, faking pain, false tragic), Ugliest Man (reactive nihilism, ressentiment against God), Two Kings (morality of customs, species activity corrupted by the mob), Man with Leeches (culture as science, focus on superficial knowledge), Last Pope (culture as religion, lost faith, despairs), Voluntary Beggar (seeking kingdom of heaven/product of activity, finds it only in cows' rumination), Shadow (species activity lost and searching).

> The section introduces the various figures that constitute the "higher man" in *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*. These characters represent different facets or outcomes of human culture and species activity, often embodying forms of reactive nihilism, bad conscience, or failed attempts at transcendence, serving as complex images both for reactive man's self-perception and the problematic products of history.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">What constitutes man and his world is not only a particular type of force, but a mode of becoming of forces in general, not reactive forces in particular, but the becoming-reactive of all forces. Now, such a becoming of forces always requires, as its terminus a quo, the presence of the opposite quality, which in becoming passes into its opposite.</mark> [Page 190](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GB9Y2PUK)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is therefore a human activity, there are active forces of man; but these particular forces are only the nourishment of all forces which defines man and the human world.</mark> [Page 190](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJA9CWX3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">essentially. The movement of reapÂ­propriations, dialectical activity, is nothing more or less than the becoming-reactive of man and in man.</mark> [Page 191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y26M6WD5)

- [N] Man and his world are characterized by a "becoming-reactive" of forces in general, not just reactive forces themselves.
- [N] This becoming requires the presence of active forces as a starting point that passes into its opposite (reactive).
- [N] Human active forces exist but serve as "nourishment" for the overall becoming-reactive of man.
- [N] Dialectical activity/reappropriation is equated with this becoming-reactive of man.

> Man's essence is not merely being reactive but rather embodying a process where forces in general undergo a "becoming-reactive." While active forces are present in man, they are ultimately subsumed or transformed within this dominant reactive process, which is also identified with dialectical movement.

### Overman vs. Higher Man

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Overman is not a man who surpasses himself and succeeds in surpassing himself. The Overman and the higher man differ in nature; both in the instances which produce them and in the goals that they attain .</mark> [Page 191](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DULN3LZ3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the condi tions which would make the enterprise of higher man viable are conditions which would change its nature : Dionysian affirmation rather than man's species activity. The element of affirmation is the superhuman element. The element ofaffirmation is what man lacks even and above all the higher man .</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TP56K822)

- [N] The Overman is fundamentally different from the "higher man"; the Overman is not simply man who overcomes himself.
- [N] They differ in their origin (producing instances) and goals.
- [N] The higher man's endeavor would require a change in nature, specifically the element of Dionysian affirmation (superhuman element) which man/higher man lacks.

> The Overman is a distinct type from the "higher man" and is not a mere self-overcoming of man. The higher man operates within human limits; his potential realization would require the incorporation of a superhuman element of Dionysian affirmation, which he inherently lacks.

### Limitations of the Higher Man

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1) There are things that the higher man does not know how to do: to laugh , to play and to dance !</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KG777TVJ)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) The higher men themselves recognise the ass as their "superior" .</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KDA8GGH3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) The symbolism ofthe shadow has a related sense. The shadow is the activity of man, but it needs light as a higher instance; without light it vanishes; with light it is transformed and disappears in another way, changing in nature when it is midday</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GRXX46JV)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">4) One of the two fire-dogs is the caricature of the other. One bustles about on the surface , in the din and the fumes . It feeds on the surface,</mark> [Page 193](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AHPLVZWR)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">it makes the mud boil: that i s to say its activity only serves to nourish, warm up and maintain a becoming-reactive, a becoming cynical in the universe . But the other fire-dog is an affirmative animal: "Which really speaks from the heart of the earth . . . Laughter flutters from him like a motley cloud"</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QVUHDLYP)

- [N] Higher man lacks the capacities for Dionysian laughter, play, and dance.
- [N] They recognize the ass (symbol of affirmation of the real, including nihilism) as superior, indicating their limitation.
- [N] The shadow symbolizes human activity dependent on a higher light (affirmation); it disappears or changes nature under this light.
- [N] There's a contrast between a surface, reactive "fire-dog" (human activity supporting becoming-reactive) and a deeper, affirmative "fire-dog" (Dionysian).

> The limitations of the "higher man" are highlighted by his inability to laugh, play, and dance, his acknowledgment of the ass's superiority (in its passive affirmation of reality), and the superficial/reactive nature of his activity compared to the truly affirmative force symbolized by the other fire-dog.

### Nihilism and Transmutation: the focal point

<mark class="hltr-purple">9. Nihilism and Transmutation: the focal point</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3D7E6SCR)

### Transvaluation and Defeating Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But when the element is changed, then , and only then , can it be said that all values known or knowable up to the present have been reversed . Nihilism has been defeated: activity recovers its rights but only in relation and in affnity with the deeper instance from which these derive . Becoming-active appears in the universe, but as identical with affirmation as will to power.</mark> [Page 194](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NNYA4X6Q)
- [N] Transvaluation, defeating nihilism

- [N] True reversal/transvaluation of values occurs when the underlying "element" or principle (will to power as affirmation) changes.
- [N] This change defeats nihilism.
- [N] Activity is restored, aligned with affirmation as will to power.
- [N] Becoming-active is identified with affirmation as will to power.

> The defeat of nihilism and the true transvaluation of values occur through a change in the fundamental element (will to power as affirmation). This restores activity, which becomes synonymous with affirmative will to power and becoming-active.

### Nihilism as Ratio Cognoscendi of Will to Power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The will to power is spirit, but what would we know of spirit without the spirit of revenge which reveals strange powers to us? The will to power is body, but what would we know of the body without the sickness which makes it known to us? Thus nihilism, the will to nothingness, is not only a will to power, a quality of the will to power, but the ratio cognoscendi ofthe will to power in genera/ .22* All known and knowable values are , by nature , values which derive from this ratio . - If nihilism makes the will to power known to us, then conversely, the latter teaches us that it is known to us in only one form, in the form of the negative which constitutes only one of its aspects, one of its qualities .</mark> [Page 195](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8MVE6QN5)

- [N] Nihilism (will to nothingness) is not just a quality of will to power but its *ratio cognoscendi* (reason for knowing) in general.
- [N] We understand aspects of will to power (like spirit/body) through negative manifestations (revenge, sickness).
- [N] Known values derive from this understanding through nihilism.
- [N] Through nihilism, will to power is known primarily in its negative form.

> Nihilism, specifically the will to nothingness, functions as the *ratio cognoscendi* (reason for knowing) of will to power. We apprehend facets of will to power through its negative manifestations like revenge and sickness. Consequently, our understanding of will to power, and the values derived from it, are primarily based on its negative quality.

#on/nihilism #on/willtopower #on/ratiocognoscendi

### Affirmation as Ratio Essendi of Will to Power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The other side of the will to power, the unknown side, the other quality of the will to power, the unknown quality, is affirmation . And affirmation , in turn, is not merely a will to power, a quality of the will to power, it is the ratio essendi ofthe will to power in general. 23 * It is the ratio essendi of the will to power as a whole and therefore the ratio which expels the negative from this will , j ust as negation was the ratio cognoscendi of the whole will to power (thus the ratio which does not fail to eliminate the affirmative from the knowledge of this will). New values derive from affirmation : values which were unknown up to the present , that is to say up to the moment when the legislator takes the place of the " scholar" , creation takes the place of knowledge itself and affirmation takes the place of all negations .</mark> [Page 196](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SMXEFNX2)

- [N] Affirmation is the unknown quality and *ratio essendi* (reason for being) of will to power in general.
- [N] Affirmation is the reason for the *being* of will to power as a whole, expelling the negative from it.
- [N] Affirmation gives rise to new values, previously unknown.
- [N] This occurs when creation replaces knowledge and affirmation replaces negation.

> Affirmation represents the unknown, affirmative quality of will to power, serving as its *ratio essendi* (reason for being). It is the fundamental principle that constitutes the being of will to power and gives rise to truly new values, contrasting with the negative knowledge provided by nihilism.

### Transmutation: From Ratio Cognoscendi to Ratio Essendi

<mark class="hltr-yellow">L3SF92S5</mark> [Page 196](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=196&annotation=L3SF92S5)
- [N] Nihilism expresses the quality of the negative as ratio cognoscendi of the will to power; but it cannot be brought to completion without transmuting itself into the opposite quality, into affirmation as ratio essendi of this same will. A Dionysian transmutation of pain into joy, which Dionysus announces in reply to Ariadne in a suitably mysterious way "Must we not first of all hate ourselves if we have to love ourselves?"

<mark class="hltr-yellow">I love the one who makes use of nihilism as the ratio cognoscendi of the will to power, but who finds in the will to power a ratio essendi in which man is overcome and therefore nihilism is defeated .</mark> [Page 197](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LVBP2YCM)

- [N] Nihilism (negative, ratio cognoscendi) must transmute into affirmation (ratio essendi) to be completed.
- [N] This is a Dionysian transmutation (e.g., pain into joy).
- [N] The one who utilizes nihilism as a way of knowing will to power but finds its true being in affirmation (overcoming man and nihilism) is celebrated.

> The process of transmutation involves the negative knowledge provided by nihilism (ratio cognoscendi) being transformed into the affirmative being of will to power (ratio essendi). This Dionysian process overcomes both man and nihilism, replacing the negative principle with an affirmative one.

### Active Destruction and Affirmative Power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Active destruction means: the point, the moment of transmutation in the will to nothingness. Destruction becomes active at the moment when , with the alliance between reactive forces and the will to nothingness broken, the will to nothingness is converted and crosses over to the side ofaffirmation , it is related to a power ofaffirming which destroys the reactive forces themselves . Destruction becomes active to the extent that the negative is transmuted and converted into affirmative power: the "eternal joy of becoming" which is avowed in an instant , the "joy of annihilation" , the "affirmation of annihilation and destruction" (EH "Birth of Tragedy" 3 ) .</mark> [Page 197](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MX7T3K35)

- [N] Active destruction is the moment of transmutation within the will to nothingness.
- [N] Destruction becomes active when the will to nothingness allies with affirmation against reactive forces.
- [N] The negative is transmuted into affirmative power, leading to "joy of destruction" and affirmation of annihilation.

> Active destruction is the transformative moment where the will to nothingness, breaking its alliance with reactive forces, is transmuted into an affirmative power that destroys those same reactive forces. This conversion of the negative leads to a joyful, affirmative destruction.

### Transmutation as Conversion

<mark class="hltr-yellow">in transmu tation , we are not concerned with a simple substitution, but with a conversion .</mark> [Page 198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G8SBLPKE)

- [N] Transmutation is not merely swapping things out, but a fundamental conversion of nature.

> Transmutation signifies a deep conversion or transformation in the nature of the negative, rather than a simple replacement.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The element of values changes place and nature, the value ofvalues changes its principle and the whole of evaluation changes character.</mark> [Page 198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8A8HUAY)

<mark class="hltr-purple">2) The transitionfrom the ratio cognoscendi to the ratio essendi in the will to power .</mark> [Page 198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X8JJ5SJ9)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We will only think the will to power as it is , we will only think it as having being, if we use the ratio for knowing as a quality which passes into its opposite and find in this opposite the ratio for being unknown .</mark> [Page 198](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CSQNTXUR)

<mark class="hltr-purple">3) Conversion ofthe element in the will to power .</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2P9HBAK)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the man who wants to perish, the man who wants to be overcome, negation changes sense , it becomes a power of affirming</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BBRUQS8)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is no other power but affirmation, no other quality, no other element: the whole of negation is converted in its substance, transmuted in its quality, nothing remains ofits own power or autonomy .</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/23GQUCRY)

<mark class="hltr-purple">5 ) Critique ofknown values .</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/86GYVD2I)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Sovereign affirmation is inseparable from the destruc tion of all known values, it turns this destruction into a total destruc tion .</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N7Q3596P)

<mark class="hltr-purple">6) Reversal ofthe relation offorces .</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUPTL8M2)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Affirmation constitutes becoming active as the universal becoming of forces. Reactive forces are denied, all forces become active .</mark> [Page 199](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SRXPTUDY)

- [N] The triumph of affirmation involves: 1) Change of quality in will to power, altering the basis of values and evaluation. 2) Transition from ratio cognoscendi (knowing via negation) to ratio essendi (being via affirmation). 3) Conversion of the element in will to power (negation becomes affirmative power). 4) Reign of affirmation, where negation loses independent power and is converted. 5) Total critique and destruction of all known values. 6) Reversal of force relations, denying reactive forces and making all forces become active.

> This section details six aspects of the transformative triumph of affirmation over negation. It describes a fundamental shift in the quality and element of will to power, a transition from a negative way of knowing to an affirmative way of being, the conversion of negation into affirmative power, the establishment of affirmation's reign, the total destruction of old values, and the reversal of force relations towards universal becoming-active.

### Affirmation and Destruction

<mark class="hltr-yellow">1 ) There is no affirmation which is not immediately followed by a negation no less tremendous and unbounded than itself.</mark> [Page 200](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H9GCJXA5)

<mark class="hltr-blue">Destruction as the active destruction ofall known values is the trail of the creator: " Look at the good and the j ust ! What do they hate the most? The one who breaks their tables of values, the destroyer, the criminal: but it is he, the creator. "</mark> [Page 200](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/INSSNTLI)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2 ) There is no affirmation which is not preceded by an immense negation: "One of the essential conditions of affirmation is negation and destruction . "</mark> [Page 200](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XBQYH97P)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">It is only under the sway of affirmation that the negative is raised to its higher degree at the same time as it defeats itself: it is no longer a power and a quality but the mode of being of the one who is powerful . Then , and only then, the negative is aggression, negation becomes active , joyful destruction</mark> [Page 202](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APLT5UVN)

- [N] Affirmation is always closely linked to negation and destruction (followed by immense negation, preceded by immense negation).
- [N] Active destruction of old values is the mark of the creator.
- [N] Under the rule of affirmation, negation is elevated *and* defeated, becoming a mode of being of the powerful.
- [N] Only then does negation become active, joyful aggression/destruction.

> Affirmation and negation are intimately linked: immense negation precedes and follows affirmation. The creator is also a destroyer of old values. Under the dominance of affirmation, negation loses its independent power but becomes an active, joyful force of destruction for the powerful, a mere mode of their being.

### The Sense of Affirmation

<mark class="hltr-purple">1 1 . The Sense of Affirmation</mark> [Page 203](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IVRXRGAD)

### False Affirmation: The Ass's Yes to Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">we can guess the meaning of the ass' affirmation , of the yes which does not know how to say no : this kind ofaffirming is nothing but bearing, taking upon oneself, acquiescing in the real as it is , taking reality as it is upon oneself.</mark> [Page 204](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KSHP8QA3)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The men of the present still live under an old idea: that everything heavy is real and positive, that everything that carries it is real and affirmative . But this reality which unites the camel and its burden to the point of confusing them in a single mirage is only the desert , the reality of the desert, nihilism.</mark> [Page 205](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2KV6LQE)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The ass does not know how to say no; but first and foremost he does not know how to say no to nihilism itself. He gathers all its products, he carries them into the desert and there christens them: the real as such.</mark> [Page 205](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TC5XFBRN)

- [N] The "ass' affirmation" is a passive "yes" that cannot say no, merely acquiescing to and bearing the "real as it is."
- [N] This idea that the heavy/burdened is real and affirmative is old and leads to the "desert" of nihilism.
- [N] The ass says yes to everything, including nihilism, mistaking the products of nihilism for reality.

> The "ass's affirmation" is a false, passive affirmation that merely accepts reality as it is, failing to say "no" even to nihilism. It embodies the outdated idea that accepting burdens equates to affirmation, ultimately affirming the "desert" of nihilism.

### Being, Real, True as Avatars of Nihilism

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Hegelian being is pure and simple nothingness; and the becoming that this being forms with nothingness, that is to say with itself, is a perfectly nihilistic becoming; and affirmation passes through negation here because it is merely the affirmation of the negative and its products .</mark> [Page 206](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEQMNB28)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">l) Being, the true and the real are the avatars of nihilism . Ways of mutilating life, of denying it, of making it reactive by submitting it to the labour of the negative, by loading it with the heaviest burdens . Nietzsche has no more belief in the self-sufficiency of the real than he has in that of the true: he thinks ofthem as the manifestations of a will , a will to depreciate life, to oppose life to life .</mark> [Page 207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/92Q3EADC)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">2) Affirmation conceived o f a s acceptance, a s affirmation o f that which is, as truthfulness of the true or positivity of the real, is a false affirmation . It is the yes of the ass . The ass does not know how to say no because he says yes to everything which is no . The ass or the camel is the opposite of the lion; in the lion negation becomes a power of affirming, but in them affirmation remains at the service of the negative , a simple power of denying .</mark> [Page 207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EBAVHFY7)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">3) This false conception of affirmation is still a way of preserving man . As long as being is a burden the reactive man is there to carry it . Where could being be better affirmed than in the desert? And where could man be better preserved. "The last man lives the longest. " Beneath the sun of being he loses even the taste for dying, disap pearing into the desert to dream at length of a passive extinction.</mark> [Page 207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZPVZMDY)

- [N] Hegelian being is nihilistic nothingness; its becoming is also nihilistic, where affirmation is merely of the negative.
- [N] "Being," "truth," and "reality" are manifestations ("avatars") of nihilism.
- [N] They are ways of mutilating/denying life and making it reactive by imposing burdens.
- [N] Affirmation as acceptance of what "is" (truthfulness of true, positivity of real) is false (the ass's yes). This affirmation serves the negative.
- [N] This false affirmation preserves the reactive man ("last man") by making him carry the burden of "being" in the "desert" of nihilism.

> "Being," "truth," and "reality" are seen as manifestations of nihilism that serve to devalue and make life reactive by imposing burdens. The false affirmation of accepting "what is" (the "ass's yes") is a reactive stance that ultimately preserves the domesticated "last man" within the nihilistic landscape.

### True Affirmation as Creation and Liberation

<mark class="hltr-green">The world is neither true nor real but living. And the living world is will to power, will to falsehood , which is actualised in many different powers . To actualise the will to falsehood under any power whatever, to actualise the will to power under any quality whatever, is always to evaluate . To live is to evaluate . There is no truth of the world as it is thought , no reality of the sensible world , all is evaluation, even and above all the sensible and the real .</mark> [Page 207](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DWXQMC7V)

<mark class="hltr-green">To affirm is still to evaluate, but to evaluate from the perspective of a will which enjoys its own difference in life instead of suffering the pains ofthe opposition to this life that it has itself inspired . To affirm is not to take responsibility for , to take on the burden ofwhat is, but to release, to setfree what lives . To affirm is to unburden: not to load life with the weight of higher values, but to create new values which are those of life , which make life light and active . There is creation, properly speaking, only insofar as we make use of excess in order to invent new forms of life rather than separating life from what it can do .</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/44JQYH48)

<mark class="hltr-green">The sense of affirma tion can only emerge if these three fundamental points in Nietzsche's philosophy are borne in mind : not the true nor the real but evaluation; not affirmation as acceptance but as creation; not man but the Over man as a new form of life .</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P443HL25)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Dionysian yes, on the contrary, knows how to say no: it is pure affirmation , it has conquered nihilism and divested negation of all autonomous power. But it has done this because it has placed the negative at the service of the powers of affirming.</mark> [Page 208](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W3G942GV)

- [N] The world is living (will to power/falsehood), not true or real; life is evaluation.
- [N] All is evaluation, including the sensible and real.
- [N] True affirmation is evaluation from the perspective of a will that enjoys difference and liberates life, rather than suffering opposition.
- [N] Affirmation is creation, not accepting burdens; it creates life-affirming values that make life light and active.
- [N] Creation uses excess to invent new life forms, not limit capacity.
- [N] Understanding affirmation requires focusing on: evaluation (not truth/reality), creation (not acceptance), and the Overman (not man).
- [N] The Dionysian "yes" includes the power to say "no"; it is pure affirmation that subordinates negation to its affirmative power.

> True affirmation is not passive acceptance of "what is" but an active, creative process of evaluation that liberates life and invents new possibilities. It is the Dionysian "yes" that is powerful enough to incorporate and subordinate negation, stemming from the fundamental reality of the world as a living, evaluating will to power, leading to the emergence of the Overman.

### The Double Affirmation: Ariadne

<mark class="hltr-purple">1 2 . The Double Affirmation: A riadne</mark> [Page 209](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7W5RCBSX)

### Affirmation is Being, Double Affirmation Constitutes Power

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Affirmation itself is being, being is solely affirmation in all its power.</mark> [Page 209](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZTFCDGWL)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Being and nothingness are merely the abstract expression of affirmation and negation as qualities (qualia) of the will to power .</mark> [Page 209](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y8ICEEGN)

<mark class="hltr-green">Affirmation has no object other than itself. To be precise it is being insofar as it is its own object to itself. Affirmation as object of affirma tion - this is being. In itself and as primary affirmation, it is becoming . But it is being insofar as it is the obj ect of another affirmation which raises becoming to being or which extracts the being of becoming. This is why affirmation in all its power is double: affirmation is affirmed . It is primary affirmation (becoming) which is being, but only as the object of the second affirmation . The two affirmations constitute the power of affirming as a whole.</mark> [Page 209](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KK5AF3F5)

- [N] Affirmation is synonymous with being itself.
- [N] Being and nothingness are abstract qualities of will to power (affirmation/negation).
- [N] Affirmation's object is itself; this self-affirmation *is* being.
- [N] Primary affirmation is becoming.
- [N] Becoming becomes being when it is the object of a *second* affirmation.
- [N] Affirmation is double: primary affirmation (becoming) and the second affirmation which affirms the first, making it being.
- [N] The power of affirming as a whole is constituted by this double affirmation.

> Affirmation is equated with being. The full power of affirmation is double: a primary affirmation (becoming) which becomes being only when it is made the object of a second affirmation. This self-reflection and affirmation of affirmation is what constitutes being and the total power of affirming.

"35 Dionysus is the labyrinth and the bull, becoming and being, but becoming is only being insofar as its affirmation is itself affirmed .</mark> [Page 211](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/24HL9DWG)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The ear is labyrinthine, the ear is the labyrinth of becoming or the maze of affirmation . The labyrinth is what leads us to being, the only being is that of becoming, the only being is that of the labyrinth itself.</mark> [Page 211](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IY2JNQUD)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Affirmation is posited for the first time as multiplicity , becoming and chance . For multiplicity is the difference of one thing from another, becoming is difference from self and chance is difference " between all" or dis tributive difference .</mark> [Page 212](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8U9RXX3B)

- [N] Double affirmation is symbolized by Zarathustra's two animals (eagle/serpent), Dionysus and Ariadne, and the labyrinth/ears.
- [N] Dionysus (becoming) and Ariadne (reflection/second affirmation) form the divine couple, where Dionysian becoming becomes being by being affirmed by Ariadne ("Eternal affirmation of being, eternally I am your affirmation").
- [N] The labyrinth symbolizes becoming/affirmation of becoming, leading to being. Dionysus *is* the labyrinth whose affirmation is affirmed by Ariadne.
- [N] The ear is also a labyrinth symbolizing the maze of affirmation.
- [N] Primary affirmation is multiplicity, becoming, and chance (forms of difference).

> The concept of double affirmation is expressed through key Nietzschean symbols: the eagle/serpent, Dionysus and Ariadne, and the labyrinth/ears. Dionysus represents primary affirmation (becoming), and Ariadne represents the second affirmation that reflects back and elevates becoming to being. The labyrinth symbolizes the process of navigating becoming through affirmation, leading to the realization that the only being is becoming itself.

### Eternal Return as Synthesis of Affirmation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Becoming is being, multiplicity is unity, chance is necessity . The affirmation of becoming is the affirmation of being etc . - but only insofar as it is the obj ect of the second affirmation which raises it to this new power. Being ought to belong to becoming, unity to multiplicity, necessity to chance , but only insofar as becoming, multiplicity and chance are reflected in the second affirmation which takes them as its object . 36* It is thus in the nature of affirmation to return or of difference to reproduce itself. Return is the being of becoming, the unity of multiplicity, the necessity of chance: the being of difference as such or the eternal return .</mark> [Page 212](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SLL3AA6U)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Dionysus developed , reflected , raised to the highest power: these are the aspects of Dionysian willing which serve as principles for the eternal return .</mark> [Page 212](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D7WADEJF)

- [N] Becoming = being, multiplicity = unity, chance = necessity *only* when affirmed by the second affirmation.
- [N] The second affirmation makes being belong to becoming, unity to multiplicity, necessity to chance.
- [N] It is in the nature of affirmation/difference to return/reproduce.
- [N] Return is the being of becoming/difference, the unity of multiplicity, necessity of chance = the eternal return.
- [N] Eternal return principles are aspects of Dionysian willing elevated by reflection/second affirmation.

> The eternal return is the synthesis achieved through this double affirmation. The second affirmation elevates the primary affirmation (becoming, multiplicity, chance) so that becoming attains being, multiplicity attains unity, and chance attains necessity. The eternal return embodies this highest power of affirmed affirmation, which is the being of difference itself.

### Difference is Pure Affirmation

<mark class="hltr-yellow">becoming, multiplicity and chance do not contain any negation; difference is pure affirmation; return is the being of difference excluding the whole of the negative .</mark> [Page 213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T9TNRTC6)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">difference is happy; that multiplicity, becoming and chance are ade quate objects of joy by themselves and that only joy returns.</mark> [Page 213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CT9NYWMC)

- [N] Becoming, multiplicity, and chance contain no negation; difference itself is pure affirmation.
- [N] The being of difference (eternal return) excludes the negative.
- [N] Difference is happy; multiplicity, becoming, and chance are objects of joy; only joy returns.

> Becoming, multiplicity, and chance, as forms of difference, are inherently positive and joyful, containing no negation. Difference itself is pure affirmation, and the eternal return, as the being of difference, is the realm where only joy returns.

### Reign of the Negative

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is no unhappy consciousness which is not also man's enslavement, a trap for the will and an opportunity for all basenesses of thought. The reign of the negative is the reign of powerful beasts, Churches and States , which fetter us to their own ends.</mark> [Page 213](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMV39RI2)

- [N] Unhappy consciousness is linked to man's enslavement and the reign of the negative.
- [N] The reign of the negative is embodied by institutions (Churches, States) that restrict will for their own purposes.

> Unhappy consciousness signifies the enslavement of man under the "reign of the negative," which is characterized by powerful institutions (Churches, States) that restrict the will.

### Transmutation and Joyful Destruction

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Transmutation relates the negative to affirmation in the will to power, it is turned into a simple mode of being of the powers of affirming. Instead of the labour of opposition or the suffering of the negative we have the warlike play of difference , affirmation and the j oy of destruc tion . The no stripped of its power, transformed into the opposite quality, turned affirmative and creative : such is transmutation .</mark> [Page 214](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TNRWP5F8)

- [N] Transmutation subordinates the negative to affirmation as a mode of being for affirmative powers.
- [N] It replaces the suffering/labor of the negative with the joyful play of difference, affirmation, and destruction.
- [N] Negation is transformed into an affirmative, creative force through transmutation.

> Transmutation transforms the negative into a mere mode of being for the powers of affirmation, replacing the suffering of negation with the joyful, warlike play of difference and destruction. Negation becomes an affirmative, creative force.

### Affirmative Powers: Dance, Play, Laughter

<mark class="hltr-green">every Nietzschean concept lies at the crossing of two unequal genetic lines. Not only the eternal return and the Overman, but laughter, play and dance. In relation to Zarathustra laughter, play</mark> [Page 216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VCATBTQB)

<mark class="hltr-green">and dance are affirmative powers of transmutation: dance transmutes heavy into light, laughter transmutes suffering into joy and the play of throwing (the dice) transmutes low into high . But in relation to Dionysus dance, laughter and play are affirmative powers of reflec tion and development . Dance affirms becoming and the being of becoming; laughter, roars of laughter, affirm multiplicity and the unity ofmultiplicity; play affirms chance and the necessity ofchance.</mark> [Page 217](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7CMCUPJN)

- [N] Many Nietzschean concepts (eternal return, Overman, etc.) are at the intersection of two genetic lines.
- [N] Laughter, play, and dance are affirmative powers.
- [N] For Zarathustra, they are powers of *transmutation* (heavy to light, suffering to joy, low to high).
- [N] For Dionysus, they are powers of *reflection and development* (affirming becoming/being, multiplicity/unity, chance/necessity).

> Laughter, play, and dance are central affirmative powers in Nietzsche's philosophy. From Zarathustra's perspective, they transmute negative states (suffering, heaviness). From Dionysus's perspective, they are powers of reflection that affirm fundamental aspects of reality like becoming, multiplicity, chance, and their corresponding "being" (eternal return, unity, necessity).

### Conclusion

<mark class="hltr-purple">Conclusion</mark> [Page 218](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AMSKAM6R)

### Dialectic as Inverted and Reactive

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Hegelian dialectic is indeed a reflection on difference, but it inverts its image . For the affirmation of difference as such it substitutes the negation of that which differs; for the affirmation of self it substitutes the negation of the other, and for the affirmation of affirmation it substitutes the famous negation of the negation .</mark> [Page 219](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YB7VDCYW)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Opposition substituted for difference is also the triumph of the reactive forces that find their corresponding principle in the will to nothingness. Ressentiment needs negative premisses, two negations, in order to produce a phantom of affirmation; the ascetic ideal needs ressentiment itself and bad conscience, like the conjuror needs his marked cards.</mark> [Page 219](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NY3Z3MFV)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The dialectic is, first of all, the thought of the theoretical man, reacting against life, claiming to judge life, to limit and measure it . In the second place, it is the thought of the priest who subjects life to the labour of the negative: he needs negation to establish his power, he represents the strange will which leads reactive forces to triumph . Dialectic in this sense is the authentically Christian ideology . Finally , it is the thought of the slave , expressing reactive life in itself and the becoming-reactive of the universe . Even the atheism that it offers us is a clerical atheism, even its image of the master is a slavish one . - It is not surprising that the dialectic only produces a phantom of affirma tion .</mark> [Page 219](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3LT5MUY5)

- [N] Hegelian dialectic is an inverted reflection on difference, substituting negation of difference, negation of the other, and negation of the negation for true affirmation.
- [N] Dialectical opposition (vs. difference) is the triumph of reactive forces linked to the will to nothingness.
- [N] Ressentiment requires double negation for a false affirmation; the ascetic ideal relies on ressentiment/bad conscience.
- [N] Dialectic is the thought of the theoretical man (reacting against/judging life), the priest (subjecting life to negative labor), and the slave (expressing reactive life).
- [N] Dialectic is a fundamentally Christian ideology, leading to mere phantom affirmation.

> The conclusion reiterates the critique of Hegelian dialectics as an inverted form of thought that substitutes negation for true affirmation. It is presented as the philosophical expression and ideology of reactive forces, ressentiment, bad conscience, and the will to nothingness, ultimately rooted in the perspective of the theoretical man, the priest, and the slave, and incapable of genuine, affirmative creation.

### Nietzsche's Affirmative Alternative

<mark class="hltr-yellow">They moved within the limits of the question "What is . . . ?" , the contradictory question par excellence . Nietzsche creates his own method : dramatic , typological and differential . He turns philosophy into an art , the art of inter preting and evaluating . In every case he asks the question "Which one?" The one that . . . is Dionysus . That which . . . is the will to power as plastic and genealogical principle . The will to power is not force but the differential element which simultaneously determines the relation of forces (quantity) and the respective qualities of related forces . It is in this element of difference that affirmation manifests itself and develops itself as creative . The will to power is the principle of multiple affirmation, the donor principle or the bestowing virtue .</mark> [Page 220](zzotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q46U7QUM?page=220&annotation=8HDHY3MC)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We affirm chance and the necessity of chance; becoming and the being of becoming; multiplicity and the unity of multiplicity . Affirmation turns back on itself, then returns once more , carried to its highest power. Difference reflects itself and repeats or reproduces itself. The eternal return is this highest power, the synthesis of affirmation which finds its principle in the will . The lightness of that which affirms against the weight of the negative; the games of the will to power against the labour of the dialectic ; the affirmation of affirma tion against that famous negation of the negation .</mark> [Page 220](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y3CJ94EA)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Because the will to power only makes what is affirmed return: it is the will to power which both transforms the negative and reproduces affirmation . That the one isfor the other, that the one is in the other, means that eternal return is being but being is selection . Affirmation remains as the sole quality of the will to power, action as the sole quality of force , becoming-active as the creative identity of power and willing.</mark> [Page 221](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JN2T94JF)

- [N] Philosophers asking "What is...?" are limited; Nietzsche uses a dramatic, typological, differential method asking "Which one?".
- [N] Philosophy becomes the art of interpreting/evaluating.
- [N] "Which one?" leads to Dionysus and will to power (the differential/genealogical principle of forces).
- [N] Will to power is the principle of creative, multiple affirmation ("bestowing virtue").
- [N] Nietzsche affirms chance/necessity, becoming/being, multiplicity/unity.
- [N] Double affirmation/eternal return is the highest power, synthesizing affirmation.
- [N] Eternal return is being as selection.
- [N] Affirmation is the sole quality of will to power; action is sole quality of force; becoming-active is creative identity of power/willing.
- [N] This contrasts the lightness/game of affirmation/will to power with the heaviness/labor of the negative/dialectic.

> In contrast to traditional, dialectical philosophy's limiting questions and negative orientation, Nietzsche develops a new, affirmative philosophy based on interpretation, evaluation, and the question "Which one?". This method reveals the will to power as the principle of creative, multiple affirmation. Concepts like the eternal return embody the highest power of affirmation, where difference is reproduced and being is selection. This leads to a philosophy of lightness, play, and becoming-active, fundamentally opposed to the labor and negativity of the dialectic.
