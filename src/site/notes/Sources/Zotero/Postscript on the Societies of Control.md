<mark class="hltr-yellow">The individual never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, each having its own laws: first the family; then the school ("you are no longer in your family"); then the barracks ("you are no longer at school"); then the factory; from time to time the hospital; possibly the prison, the pre-eminent instance of the enclosed environment.</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=&annotation=GIW7MIDB) 

### id04376JIQ6

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Foucault has brilliantly analyzed the ideal project of these environments of enclosure, particularly visible within the factory: to concentrate; to distribute in space; to order in time; to compose a productive force within the dimension of space-time whose effect will be greater than the sum of its component forces. But what Foucault recognized as well was the transience of this model: it succeeded that of the societies of sovereignty, the goal and functions of which were something quite different (to tax rather than to organize production, to rule on death rather than to administer life)</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=&annotation=4376JIQ6) 

### id0X3VKR5EV

<mark class="hltr-green">We are in a generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of enclosure - prison, hospital, factory, school, family. The family is an "interior," in crisis like all other interiors - scholarly, professional, etc. The administrations in charge never cease announcing supposedly necessary reforms: to reform schools, to reform industries, hospitals, the armed forces, prisons. But everyone knows that these institutions are finished, whatever the length of their expiration periods. It's only a matter of administering their last rites and of keeping people employed until the installation of the new forces knocking at the door.</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=&annotation=X3VKR5EV)

### id0EAK7WJX3

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Enclosures are molds, distinct castings, but controls are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point.</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=2&annotation=EAK7WJX3) 

### id0J9UBKUTD

<mark class="hltr-blue">This is obvious in the matter of salaries: the factory was a body that contained its internal forces at the level of equilibrium, the highest possible in terms of production, the lowest possible in terms of wages; but in a society of control, the corporation has replaced the factory, and the corporation is a spirit, a gas. Of course the factory was already familiar with the system of bonuses, but the corporation works more deeply to impose a modulation of each salary, in states of perpetual metastability that operate through challenges, contests, and highly comic group sessions. If the most idiotic television game shows are so successful, it's because they express the corporate situation with great precision. The factory constituted individuals as a single body to the double advantage of the boss who surveyed each element within the mass and the unions who mobilized a mass resistance; but the corporation constantly presents the brashest rivalry as a healthy form of emulation, an excellent motivational force that opposes individuals against one another and runs through each, dividing each within. The modulating principle of "salary according to merit" has not failed to tempt national education itself. Indeed, just as the corporation replaces the factory, perpetual training tends to replace the school, and continuous control to replace the examination. Which is the surest way of delivering the school over to the corporation.</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=2&annotation=J9UBKUTD) 

### id076FJKJE3

<mark class="hltr-green">In the disciplinary societies one was always starting again (from school to the barracks, from the barracks to the factory), while in the societies of control one is never finished with anything--the corporation, the educational system, the armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the same modulation, like a universal system of deformation.</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=2&annotation=76FJKJE3) 

### id0747UGJZD

<mark class="hltr-blue">In The Trial, Kafka, who had already placed himself at the pivotal point between two types of social formation, described the most fearsome of judicial forms. The apparent acquittal of the disciplinary societies (between two incarcerations); and the limitless postponements of the societies of control (in continuous variation) are two very different modes of juridicial life, and if our law is hesitant, itself in crisis, it's because we are leaving one in order to enter the other.</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=2&annotation=747UGJZD)

### id0HQP4CYKZ

<mark class="hltr-orange">The disciplinary societies have two poles: the signature that designates the individual, and the number or administrative numeration that indicates his or her position within a mass. This is because the disciplines never saw any incompatibility between these two, and because at the same time power individualizes and masses together, that is, constitutes those over whom it exercises power into a body and molds the individuality of each member of that body. (Foucault saw the origin of this double charge in the pastoral power of the priest--the flock and each of its animals--but civil power moves in turn and by other means to make itself lay "priest.")</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=2&annotation=HQP4CYKZ) 

### id09KQK5JCV

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In the societies of control, on the other hand, what is important is no longer either a signature or a number, but a code: the code is a password, while on the other hand disciplinary societies are regulated by watchwords (as much from the point of view of integration as from that of resistance). The numerical language of control is</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=2&annotation=9KQK5JCV) 

### id0TL56E6R5

<mark class="hltr-orange">made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=TL56E6R5) 

### id07QW5QJRL

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Perhaps it is money that expresses the distinction between the two societies best, since discipline always referred back to minted money that locks gold as numerical standard, while control relates to floating rates of exchange, modulated according to a rate established by a set of standard currencies.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=7QW5QJRL) 

### id0BQFM4TP6

<mark class="hltr-green">The old monetary mole is the animal of the space of enclosure, but the serpent is that of the societies of control. We have passed from one animal to the other, from the mole to the serpent, in the system under which we live, but also in our manner of living and in our relations with others. The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network. Everywhere surfing has already replaced the older sports.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=BQFM4TP6) 

### id0EEEXAZ8Y

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Types of machines are easily matched with each type of society--not that machines are determining, but because they express those social forms capable of generating them and using them.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=EEEXAZ8Y) 

### id0VCVTTA7X

<mark class="hltr-green">The old societies of sovereignty made use of simple machines--levers, pulleys, clocks; but the recent disciplinary societies equipped themselves with machines involving energy, with the passive danger of entropy and the active danger of sabotage; the societies of control operate with machines of a third type, computers, whose passive danger is jamming and whose active one is piracy or the introduction of viruses. This technological evolution must be, even more profoundly, a mutation of capitalism, an already well-known or familiar mutation that can be summed up as follows: nineteenth-century capitalism is a capitalism of concentration, for production and for property. It therefore erects a factory as a space of enclosure, the capitalist being the owner of the means of production but also, progressively, the owner of other spaces conceived through analogy (the worker's familial house, the school).</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=VCVTTA7X) 

### id0ZWJZSFSC

<mark class="hltr-yellow">in the present situation, capitalism is no longer involved in production, which it often relegates to the Third World, even for the complex forms of textiles, metallurgy, or oil production. It's a capitalism of higher-order production. It no-longer buys raw materials and no longer sells the finished products: it buys the finished products or assembles parts. What it wants to sell is services but what it wants to buy is stocks. This is no longer a capitalism for production but for the product, which is to say, for being sold or marketed. Thus is essentially dispersive, and the factory has given way to the corporation.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=ZWJZSFSC) 

### id0UWJC2BZE

<mark class="hltr-green">The family, the school, the army, the factory are no longer the distinct analogical spaces that converge towards an owner - state or private power - but coded figures - deformable and transformable - of a single corporation that now has only stockholders.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=UWJC2BZE) 

### id0TV5INCCQ

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Even art has left the spaces of enclosure in order to enter into the open circuits of the bank. The conquests of the market are made by grabbing control and no longer by disciplinary training, by fixing the exchange rate much more than by lowering costs, by transformation of the product more than by specialization of production.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=TV5INCCQ) 

### id0QCHM35AS

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Marketing has become the centre or the "soul" of the corporation. We are taught that corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying news in the world.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=QCHM35AS) 

### id0MFX6HU92

<mark class="hltr-green">The operation of markets is now the instrument of social control and forms the impudent breed of our masters. Control is short-term and of rapid rates of turnover, but also continuous and without limit, while discipline was of long duration, infinite and discontinuous. Man is no longer man enclosed, but man in debt.</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=3&annotation=MFX6HU92)

### id0ME4XAIVG

<mark class="hltr-blue">Felix Guattari has imagined a city where one would be able to leave one's apartment, one's street, one's neighbourhood, thanks to one's (dividual) electronic card that raises a given barrier; but the card could just as easily be rejected on a given day or between certain hours; what counts is not the barrier but the computer that tracks each person's position - licit or illicit - and effects a universal modulation.</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=4&annotation=ME4XAIVG) 

### id0FDGA9MFS

<mark class="hltr-blue">In the prison system: the attempt to find penalties of "substitution," at least for petty crimes, and the use of electronic collars that force the convicted person to stay at home during certain hours. For the school system: continuous forms of control, and the effect on the school of perpetual training, the corresponding abandonment of all university research, the introduction of the "corporation" at all levels of schooling. For the hospital system: the new medicine "without doctor or patient" that singles out potential sick people and subjects at risk, which in no way attests to individuation--as they say--but substitutes for the individual or numerical body the code of a "dividual" material to be controlled. In the corporate system: new ways of handling money, profits, and humans that no longer pass through the old factory form.</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LMBKA6WI?page=4&annotation=FDGA9MFS)
