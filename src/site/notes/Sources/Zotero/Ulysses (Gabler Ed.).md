### Stephen's Reflection on Sea and Mother [Page 20]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet  mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline held a  dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside her  deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her  rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=20&annotation=4RMBDNQ5)

> This passage connects the sea, seen by Stephen, to the image of his dying mother. The "wellfed voice beside him" belongs to Buck Mulligan, who hails the sea as a "great sweet mother". Stephen's immediate internal response is a grim memory of his own mother's deathbed suffering, juxtaposing the romanticized view of nature with the harsh reality of decay and death.

### Caliban and the Cracked Lookingglass [Page 21]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If Wilde  were only alive to see you!  Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:  -It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=21&annotation=9AMVJ5NX)

> Buck Mulligan quotes Caliban from Shakespeare's *The Tempest* ("the rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror"), mockingly directed at Stephen. He also invokes Oscar Wilde, who studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where Stephen later recalls a memory. Stephen's famous retort, "It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant," is a variation of Wilde's statement about the artist: "For he who would stand apart from the world, must lie to it; and he to whom the soul of life is a spectator, must make to it an image of itself, and bow down before it. For if he who would look at life through the artist's tempera, must allow it to be the mirror of the soul..." (from Wilde's preface to *The Picture of Dorian Gray*). Stephen's version implies Irish art is flawed or damaged, perhaps by colonialism or servitude.

### Oxford College Memory (Part 1) [Page 21]
<mark class="hltr-magenta">Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms.  Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. 0, I  shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit  ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table,  with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor's</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=21&annotation=T8W2NVJL)

> This begins a memory of Stephen's time at university (likely Oxford, based on earlier allusions). It depicts a scene of rowdy, upper-class students ("moneyed voices", "Palefaces") engaged in horseplay ("hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels") involving someone named Aubrey and "Ades of Magdalen" (Magdalen College, Oxford). The phrase "I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die!" mimics a dramatic, affected speech common among the aesthetes of the time, potentially referencing Wilde or his circle.

### Oxford College Memory (Part 2) [Page 22]
<mark class="hltr-magenta">shears. A scared calfs face gilded with marmalade. I don't want to be 110  debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=22&annotation=IL56Y3BP)

> This continues the memory from the previous page. "Debagged" means having one's trousers pulled down, a common university prank. The mention of a "tailor's shears" adds a touch of menace or caricature. The dialogue "I don't want to be debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!" captures the frantic tone of the victim and the mocking language of the tormentors. The memory highlights Stephen's feeling of alienation or discomfort among his wealthier, more boisterous peers.

### White Breast of the Dim Sea [Page 23]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">White breast of the  dim sea. Th~ twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings,  merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the  dim tide.</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=23&annotation=4D9WTS84)

> This is a poetic, sensory description of the sea from Stephen's perspective. It uses evocative imagery ("White breast", "twining stresses", "Wavewhite wedded words") and sound ("harpstrings", "twining chords") to capture the visual and auditory experience of the waves. It reflects Stephen's artistic sensibility and his internal processing of his environment.

### Memories of His Mother [Page 24]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset  his brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had  approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting  for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails  reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's shirts.</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=24&annotation=B29BSR9J)
- [N] memories of mom

> Stephen's stream of consciousness returns to memories of his mother, contrasting simple, poignant domestic details (a glass of water, a roasted apple) with a stark, visceral image of her physical reality ("fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice"). These fragmented memories reveal his complex, often guilt-ridden, feelings about his mother.

### The Milkwoman [Page 27]
<mark class="hltr-green">He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=27&annotation=5APRFWXA)
- [N] The old lady pours the milk

> Stephen observes an old milkwoman delivering milk to the tower. His thoughts about her transform her from a simple vendor into a figure of ancient Ireland, a "wandering crone" with a mystical connection to the land and cattle ("Silk of the kine"). He sees her as a "lowly form of an immortal," suggesting she represents a dying past or tradition serving the new order ("her conqueror and her gay betrayer"). His complex, symbolic interpretation elevates a mundane interaction into a meditation on history, identity, and betrayal. "tilly" is an extra measure given by the vendor, a custom in Ireland.

### Ashplant and the Key [Page 32]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his  side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My  familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the  path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants that 630  key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the key  too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=32&annotation=INBRVVY7)

> Stephen walks, accompanied by the sound of his ashplant (walking stick), which he personifies as his "familiar" calling his name. His thoughts shift to Buck Mulligan, who is staying in the tower and wants the key. Stephen reflects on the power dynamic â€“ he paid the rent, but Mulligan is essentially the host now ("eat his salt bread," an idiom for dependency). The key becomes a symbol of ownership, independence, and the tension between them.

### Growth of Rite and Dogma [Page 32]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a  chemistry of stars.</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=32&annotation=G8GVVTNV)

> Stephen's thought connects the gradual, complex development of religious ritual and doctrine to the development of his own abstract thoughts. Comparing this process to a "chemistry of stars" adds a cosmic, scientific, or alchemical dimension, suggesting his thoughts are both profound and perhaps subject to universal, intricate laws.

### Two Men Discussing the Drowned Man [Page 33]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman. -She's making for Bullock harbour. The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. -There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today. The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. Here I am.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=33&annotation=6B26ISQM)
- [N] interesting cut scene to some dudes on the cliff talking about the drowned man

> The narrative briefly shifts away from Stephen's perspective to an external, objective scene. Two men discuss a body expected to be recovered from the sea, a drowned man. This introduces the theme of death by drowning, which will recur and resonate throughout the novel, particularly in Bloom's thoughts and memories. It also sets the time frame ("It's nine days today" since the drowning).

### Swimmer in the Water [Page 33]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise  his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=33&annotation=3HXS4XB3)

> This is a brief, vivid sensory image of a swimmer from Stephen's perspective. The description "frogwise his green legs" uses animal imagery and color to create a specific, slightly detached observation of physical form and movement in the water.

### Bannon and "Photo Girl" [Page 33]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing  down there. Photo girl he calls her.  -Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=33&annotation=3PWYJCGK)

> This dialogue, likely between Haines and Mulligan or another character, introduces the name Bannon and refers to a young woman he met, calling her "Photo girl." The response "Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure" uses photographic terms ("snapshot," "exposure") to create a pun, implying a brief, potentially casual or sexual encounter. This snippet hints at the social activities and relationships of the characters.

### Kingstown Pier: A Disappointed Bridge [Page 36]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge. The words troubled their gaze. -How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river. For Haines's chapbook. No-one here to hear.</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=36&annotation=Z5JJAYHR)

> Stephen offers a poetic, slightly absurd description of Kingstown pier as a "disappointed bridge." A bridge connects two sides across a gap (like a river), whereas a pier extends out into the water, connecting the land to nothing specific in the middle of the sea. This reflects Stephen's tendency towards symbolic and unconventional interpretations of the world. The reaction ("How, sir?") and the thought "No-one here to hear" suggest his ideas are often misunderstood or unappreciated by those around him. "Haines's chapbook" refers to Haines's potential writing project.

### History, Possibility, and Fate [Page 36]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar  not been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has  branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite so  possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that  they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave,  weaver of the wind.</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=36&annotation=YVSRJ935)

> Stephen muses on historical events (the deaths of Pyrrhus and Julius Caesar) and the philosophical question of possibility versus actuality. He ponders whether alternative outcomes were ever truly "possible" since they didn't happen. The phrase "Weave, weaver of the wind" is evocative, potentially an allusion to fate, the passage of time, or the artist's struggle to give form to the intangible.

### Aristotle, Thought, and Form [Page 36]
<mark class="hltr-green">It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=36&annotation=G6L4GUDH)

> Stephen explicitly references Aristotle, specifically concepts from his *De Anima* (On the Soul) and metaphysics: "actuality of the possible as possible," "Thought is the thought of thought" (*nous noeseos*), and "The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms." These philosophical concepts about potentiality, consciousness, and the nature of the soul appear in his mind as he recalls reading in a library in Paris. The passage contrasts the intellectual setting and ideas with sensory descriptions (a "delicate Siamese" fellow reader, his own internal mental state as a "sloth of the underworld") and reinforces his intellectual pursuits.

### Biblical Allusion and a Riddle [Page 37]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church's looms. Ay.Â 

Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro. My father gave me seeds to sow.</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=37&annotation=T555K6CY)

> Stephen recalls the Biblical phrase "To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's" (Matthew 22:21), spoken by Jesus. He interprets it as a "riddling sentence" relevant to religious doctrine. This is immediately followed by the start of a traditional riddle, hinting at themes of fatherhood, generation, and perhaps sowing seeds (ideas, life, writing).

### Mother's Love and Sacrifice [Page 38]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail's bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=38&annotation=Z4BHE5YQ)

> Stephen reflects on his perceived inadequacy ("Ugly and futile") and contrasts it with his mother's unconditional love, which he sees as having saved him from being destroyed by the world. He questions if this love was "the only true thing in life." He then evokes a disturbing image of his mother's body, associating it with the "fiery Columbanus" (an Irish saint known for his fervor and asceticism) and seeing her as reduced to ashes. The passage contrasts human sacrifice and love with the brutal indifference of nature, symbolized by the fox digging for prey, representing a harsh, predatory reality separate from human emotion.

### Shared Secrets with Father [Page 39]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=39&annotation=CEA4V2XW)

> Stephen identifies physical and perhaps character similarities with his father ("sloping shoulders, this gracelessness"). He feels a distance from his own past ("My childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there"). The core of the passage is the idea of shared, unspoken "secrets" between him and his father, which are presented as heavy, oppressive burdens ("tyrants") that both might wish to shed. This hints at the complex, strained relationship between Stephen and Simon Dedalus.

### Money as Soiled Symbol [Page 40]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols  too of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed  and misery.</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=40&annotation=VEBSXQIF)
- [N] money

> Stephen's thought process connects the natural world (seashells, symbols of beauty and power) to the money in his pocket ("A lump in my pocket"). He sees money as a symbol, but one that is "soiled by greed and misery," reflecting a cynical or critical view of wealth and its acquisition.

### Memory of the Racecourse [Page 42]
<mark class="hltr-green">Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Even money the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.Â 
Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.Â 
Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=42&annotation=ZVS8CVDB)

> Stephen recalls a chaotic, visceral memory of being at a racecourse with Cranly. The scene is filled with sensory details (mud, noise of bookies, smells, sounds of the race). The phrase "Fair Rebel!" is likely the name of a horse. The description shifts from the literal race to a metaphorical one, comparing it to a "joust of life" and ultimately to the brutal violence of battle ("uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain"). This reflects Stephen's tendency to universalize and find deeper, often grim, significance in everyday events.

### Imperturbability and Cassandra [Page 42]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of  agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who  was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=42&annotation=TJQWBLWW)

> Stephen uses the invented phrase "pluterperfect imperturbability" (playing on the grammatical term 'pluperfect') to describe the stagnant, unresponsive nature of an official body like the department of agriculture. He then alludes to Cassandra, the Trojan prophetess doomed to foretell the future but never be believed, associating unheeded warnings or frustrations with officialdom. The subsequent phrase "By a woman who was no better than she should be" is a common idiom for a woman of questionable morals, possibly a cynical or sarcastic comment on Cassandra's fate or the source of the allusion.

### History as a Nightmare [Page 43]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=43&annotation=ZTSTUI5J)

> This is one of Stephen Dedalus's most famous lines in the novel, a direct statement of his feeling of being trapped and oppressed by the past â€“ by Irish history, by colonial history, and by his personal history. It encapsulates his struggle for freedom and self-creation against the weight of tradition and consequence.

### Sunlight through Leaves [Page 45]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun  flung spangles, dancing coins.</mark> [Page 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=45&annotation=EGA4ULEU)

> A brief, poetic image describing sunlight dappling through leaves onto someone's shoulders (likely Stephen himself). The comparison to "dancing coins" gives a sense of fleeting brightness or perhaps a fleeting illusion of wealth or value in nature.

### Modality of the Visible and Signatures of Things [Page 46]
<mark class="hltr-green">Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought  through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and  seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:  coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was  aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his  sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro  di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane,  adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a  door. Shut your eyes and see.</mark> [Page 46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=46&annotation=LQZD8XPQ)

> Stephen's famous philosophical contemplation beginning "Ineluctable modality of the visible" (ineluctable meaning unavoidable). He is thinking about the nature of sight and perception â€“ what is the essence of seeing? He feels he is meant to read the "Signatures of all things," like a mystic or scientist observing the world for meaning. He then engages with Aristotelian concepts related to perception and the "diaphane" (the transparent medium through which color is perceived). "Maestro di color che sanno" ("master of those who know") is Dante's phrase for Aristotle (Inferno, Canto IV), highlighting Aristotle's authority in Stephen's intellectual world. The passage mixes serious philosophical inquiry with playful or crude interruptions ("knocking his sconce against them," "Bald he was and a millionaire") and culminates in a paradox: "Shut your eyes and see."

### Birth, Navel, and Beginnings [Page 47]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. Hello! Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=47&annotation=RPIH589L)

> Stephen's thoughts on his own birth, referring to the midwife ("One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life"). He connects individual birth to the concept of "Creation from nothing" and the shared origin of humanity ("The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh"). He includes references to mysticism ("mystic monks"), the Biblical temptation "Will you be as gods?" (Genesis 3:5), and the "omphalos" (Greek for navel, often a symbol of origin or the center). The closing lines ("Hello! Kinch here...") are fragmented, playful, and symbolic, connecting his nickname (Kinch) to Eden ("Edenville"), and primal/beginning symbols (Aleph - first letter Hebrew; Alpha - first letter Greek) with binary/digital concepts (nought, nought, one).

### Paternity and Divinity [Page 47]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the  man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her  breath. They clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the  ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A lex eterna  stays about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son  so are consubstantial?</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=47&annotation=8J3HENW6)

> Stephen continues his meditation on origin and identity, focusing on the concept of paternity and his relationship with his parents, particularly his deceased mother ("a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath"). He applies theological concepts to his own existence, questioning the nature of creation ("made not begotten") and relating it to the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity, specifically the relationship between God the Father and God the Son being "consubstantial" (of the same substance). "Lex eterna" is Latin for "eternal law," referring to divine law. This reflects Stephen's struggle with religious dogma and his attempt to understand his own place in the world through theological frameworks.

### Irreverent Biblical Allusion [Page 47]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Jesus wept: and no wonder, by  Christ!</mark> [Page 47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=47&annotation=J7I43UWU)

> Stephen quotes the shortest verse in the King James Bible, "Jesus wept" (John 11:35), typically associated with Christ's sorrow at the death of Lazarus. He immediately adds an irreverent, colloquial, and slightly blasphemous interjection ("and no wonder, by Christ!"), expressing a sense of shared despair or perhaps mocking excessive religious sentiment.

### Memory of Poverty and Hunger [Page 50]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a  dispossessed. With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging door  of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger toothache.  Encore deux minutes. Look clock. Must get. Fermi. Hired dog! Shoot him  to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass  buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not hurt? 0, that's all  right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? 0, that's all right. Shake a 190  shake. 0, that's all only all right.</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=50&annotation=BQEK7RSR)

> Stephen's fragmented memory reflects his past poverty and indignity. He recalls receiving money from his mother, a humiliating experience at the post office, physical discomfort ("Hunger toothache"), and scraps of overheard conversation or internal thoughts in French ("Encore deux minutes" - Two more minutes) and Italian ("Fermi" - Stop). The violent fantasy about the "Hired dog" being shot is abrupt and visceral, perhaps representing anger or frustration. The ending dialogue seems like a fragmented, nonsensical attempt at reconciliation or confirmation after some unclear event, emphasizing disorientation.

### Soul as Form of Forms [Page 52]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Take all, keep all. My soul walks with me,  form of forms.</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=52&annotation=GLVL989F)

> Stephen repeats the Aristotelian phrase "form of forms" (from *De Anima*), applying it to his own soul. This idea, that the soul is the capacity to understand all things by taking on their form without their matter, is linked to his perception and identity. He asserts that his soul, representing his essence or identity, accompanies him, despite external circumstances ("Take all, keep all").

### Sands as Language [Page 52]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted  here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=52&annotation=6L4W5I9A)

> Stephen uses a metaphor to connect the physical landscape (sands, stones) to language and history. The sands are seen as language deposited by time ("tide and wind have silted here"), implying that the environment itself holds meaning or speaks of the past. The stone heaps are associated with "dead builders" and decay ("warren of weasel rats"), suggesting the remnants of past civilizations or efforts are now overrun and diminished.

### Drowned Man and Mother's Death [Page 53]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me  out of horror of his death. I ... With him together down .... I could not save  330 her. Waters: bitter death: lost.</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=53&annotation=SDJZDD6Y)

> Stephen's thoughts link the abstract idea of a drowning man (perhaps the one discussed earlier on the cliff) with the intense, personal grief and guilt he feels about his inability to save his mother from death ("I could not save her."). The association is made explicit, blending the image of the drowning man's horror with his own pain related to his mother's passing. Water becomes a symbol of both death and loss.

### Dream of the Street of Harlots [Page 54]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open  hallway. Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting  it. That man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held  against my face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In.  Come. Red carpet spread. You will see who.</mark> [Page 54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=54&annotation=AK38SWCU)

> Stephen recalls a fragmented dream featuring a "Street of harlots," a reference to a red-light district. The mention of "Haroun al Raschid" evokes the caliph from *One Thousand and One Nights*, known for his nocturnal wanderings in disguise through Baghdad, often associated with exotic, sometimes illicit, adventures. The dream involves being led by a mysterious man, sensory details ("creamfruit smell"), and a sense of initiation or unveiling ("Red carpet spread. You will see who."). The dream imagery is sensual and perhaps disturbing, representing aspects of temptation or hidden desires.

### Languages of the World [Page 54]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on  their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.</mark> [Page 54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=54&annotation=QKTQYY7Q)

> Stephen contrasts different forms of language. "Monkwords, marybeads" refers to the language and sounds associated with religious practice (prayers, rosaries), seen as perhaps restrictive or repetitive ("jabber"). This is contrasted with "roguewords, tough nuggets," representing more earthy, colloquial, possibly vulgar but vibrant language. This reflects Stephen's interest in the diverse forms and vitality of language, finding value beyond formal or sacred uses.

### Stephen's Beach Walk and Poem [Page 55]
<mark class="hltr-green">A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I  am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's flaming  sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains,  drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides,  myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, oinopa ponton, a winedark sea.  Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids  her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. Omnis caro ad te  veniet. He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails  bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.  Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.  400 No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.  His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her  moomb. Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath,  unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring  wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's  letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.  Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled  words. That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=55&annotation=IHNLNDRW)

> This extended passage captures Stephen's internal monologue as he walks the beach (the Proteus episode). It's rich with allusions and sensory details. "Hamlet hat" likely refers to a specific style or his association with the character. His thoughts drift to abstract concepts ("Across the sands of all the world"), the westward movement of the moon and tides, and the female principle ("She trudges...", "A tide westering, moondrawn"). "oinopa ponton" is Homeric Greek ("wine-dark sea"), an epithet from the *Odyssey*. "Behold the handmaid of the moon" echoes the Virgin Mary's response to the Annunciation (Luke 1:38), linking the moon/tides/female cycle to religious concepts. "Bridebed, childbed, bed of death" compresses the female life cycle. "Omnis caro ad te veniet" is Latin ("All flesh shall come to thee," Psalm 65:2), linking the sea to death. The vampire image ("pale vampire") likely relates to his mother's death or the draining of vitality. He then focuses on writing, recalling a phrase ("Mouth to her mouth's kiss") and experimenting with it. The section culminates with him tearing off part of Mr. Deasy's letter (from the previous episode) and writing on it, suggesting the transformation of external reality (a letter) into internal creation (his poem). The final lines are sound-based ("moomb. Oomb, allwombing tomb") and abstract ("roar of cataractic planets").

### Written Words on a White Field [Page 55]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Who ever anywhere will  read these written words? Signs on a white field.</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=55&annotation=W3RPIFQL)

> Stephen reflects on the act of writing and its reception. He questions the future audience for his words written on the paper/sand ("Signs on a white field"). This is a meta-commentary on the solitary nature of artistic creation and the uncertainty of its impact or legacy.

### Souls Clinging in Shame [Page 55]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Darkness is in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls,  shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover  clinging, the more the more.</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=55&annotation=RCBWVKFH)

> Stephen's thought connects spiritual state ("Darkness is in our souls") and religious concepts (shame, sins) to intense physical/emotional clinging. He uses the metaphor of a woman clinging to her lover ("the more the more") to describe the way souls, wounded by sin, might cling more tightly to the self or existence. "Flutier" is likely an interjection from one of his companions, interrupting his thought.

### The Fourworded Wavespeech [Page 56]
<mark class="hltr-green">In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering  greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away.  I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks,  swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourworded  wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of waters amid  seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap:  bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely  flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.</mark> [Page 56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=56&annotation=I3YZFXV9)

> Stephen describes the incoming tide with vivid sensory language, personifying the water as speaking. He interprets the sounds of the waves as a "fourworded wavespeech," represented by the onomatopoeic sounds "seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos." This passage highlights his focus on sound and language, finding inherent meaning or expression in the natural world. He also observes the physical action of the water ("lassoes," "swirling," "slops: flop, slop, slap") and its appearance ("greengoldenly," "foampool, flower unfurling").

<mark class="hltr-yellow">-Mkgnao!</mark> [Page 60](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=60&annotation=CEMCV9Q2)
- [N] cat meow

> This is an onomatopoeic representation of a cat meowing. This sound marks the transition from Stephen's episode (Proteus) to Bloom's episode (Calypso), introducing Bloom's perspective through his interaction with a cat. It signals a shift in character focus and narrative style.

### Bloom's Eastern Fantasy [Page 62]
<mark class="hltr-green">Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers  yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you feel young.  Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travel round in  front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow  a day older technically. Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city  gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on  a long kind of a spear. Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces  going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated  crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink 90  water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a  robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the  mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the  trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother  watches me from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark  language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,  colour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those  instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=62&annotation=T6P4RWG8)
- [N] Beautiful, eastern walk

> Bloom's stream of consciousness begins with mundane observations (a breadvan, preference for stale loaves) before drifting into an elaborate fantasy of traveling to the East. This fantasy is sensory-rich (smells, sights, sounds) and exotic (turbans, mosques, carpet shops, sherbet, dulcimers). It allows Bloom to escape the routine of his Dublin life and indulge in imaginative adventure and sensuality. The memory of Molly's "violet" garters links the exotic fantasy back to his present reality and his wife. "Steal a day's march on him" is an idiom meaning to get ahead of someone.

### Smells of the Pub [Page 62]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up  the flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out  whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=62&annotation=4YBJWFYK)

> Bloom's internal monologue focuses on the distinctive smells emanating from a pub. The descriptions "flabby gush of porter" and "squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush" are visceral and specific, capturing the complex, heavy odors of a public house. This highlights Bloom's acute sensory awareness, particularly of smell.

### Schoolyard and Geography [Page 63]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He passed  Saint Joseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air  helps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee  doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their  joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.</mark> [Page 63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=63&annotation=ZFPK6S9M)

> Bloom passes a school and hears the sounds of children. His thoughts jump from the sounds of learning ("Ahbeesee defeegee...") to a geography lesson involving Irish islands (Inishturk, Inishark, Inishboffin) and then to his own name's connection to a geographical location ("Mine. Slieve Bloom" - a mountain range in Ireland). "Joggerfry" is likely Bloom's playful or misremembered pronunciation of "geography." This shows his associative mind, linking external stimuli to personal identity and knowledge.

### Cattlemarket Memory [Page 63]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their  t 60 pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots  trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter,  there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.</mark> [Page 63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=63&annotation=2CRUHM7K)

> Bloom's memory shifts to the cattle market, a scene full of visceral sounds ("beasts lowing"), smells ("flop and fall of dung"), and sights (branded sheep, breeders). The description of breeders judging the animals ("slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter") emphasizes the tactile and commercial aspects of the scene, highlighting the raw, physical world of the market.

### Observing a Woman and Sexual Thoughts [Page 64]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she  went slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the  morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood  outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed  down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted  toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting  of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a  constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them si2eable.  Prime sausage. 0 please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.</mark> [Page 64](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=64&annotation=GNJNUVH3)
- [N] Bloom's a horndog

> Bloom observes a woman walking ahead of him, and his thoughts become explicitly sexual ("behind her moving hams", "Prime sausage"). He uses idioms like "Make hay while the sun shines," reflecting his opportunistic mindset. He also notices less attractive physical details ("Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails"). His thoughts about her "Brown scapulars" (religious garment) being "in tatters, defending her both ways" suggest a mix of religious observance and underlying sensuality or disarray. He fantasizes about her with a constable and uses a suggestive phrase "0 please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood," likely a reference to a song or common euphemism for sexual advances.

### The Dead Sea of the World's Cunt [Page 65]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.  No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead  220 sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those  waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining  down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A  dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first  race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a naggin bottle by the  neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to  captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now  it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the  world.  Desolation.</mark> [Page 65](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=65&annotation=XFKLKII2)

> A passing cloud prompts a dark meditation in Bloom's mind. He imagines a "barren land" like the Dead Sea, explicitly referencing the Biblical cities of the plain destroyed by brimstone (Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom). This symbolizes decay, sin, and infertility. The image of the Dead Sea is then shockingliy conflated with the crude, desolate image of an "old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world." The "bent hag" reinforces the theme of age, decay, and perhaps the perceived barrenness of the Jewish people ("The oldest people...wandered far away"). This passage is a powerful, albeit disturbing, expression of Bloom's feelings of desolation and loss of vitality.

### Bloom in the Outhouse [Page 71]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but  resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed  his bowels to ease. themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that  slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.

Matcham often thinks of the  masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Begins and  ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He glanced back through what he had  read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy  who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.</mark> [Page 71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=71&annotation=LR8RBHJF)
- [N] taking a shit

> This passage depicts Bloom using the outhouse. It combines the mundane physical act with his reading (a story beginning "Matcham often thinks...") and internal thoughts about digestion ("constipation", "cascara sagrada"), bodily functions ("rising smell," "water flow quietly"), writing, and money (envying the author Mr. Beaufoy for being paid). The blending of the vulgar and the intellectual, the physical and the mental, is characteristic of Bloom's stream of consciousness and the novel's approach.

### Colors of Day and Night [Page 72]
<mark class="hltr-green">Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with  daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then  black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.</mark> [Page 72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=72&annotation=4PP2HFHF)

> Bloom muses on the colors associated with different times of day or activities, connecting them to potentially romantic or dramatic imagery ("girls in grey gauze," "black with daggers and eyemasks"). He sees a poetic progression ("pink, then golden, then grey, then black") but also acknowledges that this can be "true to life," demonstrating his ability to find both aesthetic patterns and grounded reality in his observations.

### Exotic Lands, Lethargy, and Physics [Page 73-74]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice  blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east.

Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol  open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of  the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of 40  the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It's a law something  like that. Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The  college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What is weight really when you  say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second per second.

It's  the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.</mark> [Page 74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=74&annotation=03ZBCAG8F)

> Bloom's thoughts drift from the warmth and aroma of his tea ("choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands") to a fantasy of the "far east," imagining an idyllic, lazy life of "dolce far niente" (sweet idleness). This romanticized view is contrasted with a fleeting, more cynical thought about "Sleeping sickness." His mind then shifts abruptly to a memory of seeing a picture of someone floating on the Dead Sea, which triggers a chain of thought about physics, specifically density, weight, and gravity. He recalls a high school lesson with his teacher Vance and scientific concepts ("Law of falling bodies"). This passage showcases the eclectic nature of Bloom's thoughts, moving fluidly between sensual fantasy, practical observation, scientific inquiry, and personal memory.

### Missed Opportunity and Allusions [Page 76]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch! t 30  A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.  Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and  the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace  street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the  display of. Esprit de corps.

Another gone.  -One of the best, M'Coy said.</mark> [Page 76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=76&annotation=TPTENTSV)

> Bloom is observing a woman's stockings ("Silk flash rich stockings white") when a tram blocks his view, causing him to miss the sight. This triggers a feeling of frustration and being shut out ("Feels locked out of it"). He compares this missed moment of pleasure to being excluded from "Paradise and the peri" (referencing Thomas Moore's poem "Lalla Rookh," where a Peri, an angelic being, is excluded from Paradise). This reflects his frequent sense of being an outsider or missing out on life's pleasures. The memory of another woman adjusting her garter reinforces the theme of fleeting, blocked desire. He then exchanges brief, somewhat detached pleasantries with M'Coy about someone who has died.

### Molly's Morning [Page 76]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating  bread and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.  Dark lady and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.  Love's.  Old.  Sweet.  Song.  Comes lo-ove's old ...</mark> [Page 76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=76&annotation=AIPIZLHZ)

> Bloom thinks about his wife, Molly. He imagines her still in bed, eating, associating her with royalty ("Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and" - a variation on nursery rhymes like "Sing a Song of Sixpence"). He sees her engaged in fortune-telling with cards ("Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens"), thinking of traditional fortune-telling figures ("Dark lady and fair man"). The mention of a "Letter" and "Torn strip of envelope" hints at Bjoylan's letter, which will become significant. The passage ends with fragments of a song lyric, "Love's Old Sweet Song," underscoring the theme of their relationship and perhaps his current feelings about it.

### A Yellow Flower [Page 78]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">A yellow flower with flattened petals.</mark> [Page 78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=78&annotation=8SCSUVVC)

> A brief, simple sensory observation of a specific flower. This reflects Bloom's tendency to notice details in his environment, even seemingly insignificant ones, grounding his thoughts in the physical world.

### Train and Porter Imagery [Page 80]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.  Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The  bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,  winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of  liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.</mark> [Page 80](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=80&annotation=EP2R2BK8)

> The sound of a train triggers a vivid, synaesthetic image in Bloom's mind. The "clanked heavily" train sound is associated with "Barrels bumped" and the physical sensation of "dull porter" (a type of beer) slopping inside his head. This internal feeling is then transformed into a large-scale image of a "huge dull flood" of liquor spreading out like a landscape. It connects the external sound, internal sensation, and a flowing, almost overwhelming, mental image.

### Thoughts in the Church [Page 81]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">They were about him here and  there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt  in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort of bread:  unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy.  360 Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called. There's a big idea behind  it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First communicants.  Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party, same in the  theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of that. Not so lonely. In  our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if  you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock  apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.  Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all  pain. Wake this time next year.</mark> [Page 81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=81&annotation=HNHFL6TG)

> Bloom observes people taking communion in the church. He makes comparisons between the communion wafer and Jewish unleavened bread ("mazzoth," "shewbread"). He speculates on the feelings of the communicants ("feel happy," "bread of angels," "kingdom of God is within you feel," "one family party"). He mixes religious terms with mundane and even slightly cynical ones ("Lollipop," "Hokypoky penny a lump," "spreeish," "Let off steam"). He lists Catholic pilgrimage sites and miracles (Lourdes, Knock apparition, statues bleeding) alongside a sleeping man, linking faith to oblivion and escape from pain ("Blind faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain."). This reflects his detached, observant, and somewhat critical perspective on religious practice.

### Thoughts on Eunuchs [Page 82]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Still, having  eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is  it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses. Connoisseurs.  Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall 4 to  into flesh, don't they? Gluttons, tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One  way out of it.</mark> [Page 82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=82&annotation=03TAXA4LT)

> Bloom's thoughts turn to the historical use of castrati (eunuchs) in church choirs. He speculates on their voices, physical characteristics ("Fall into flesh," "Gluttons, tall, long legs"), and lack of sexual drive ("wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a placid. No worry."). He sees this as a drastic "way out" of the complications of sexuality, reflecting his own anxieties and experiences.

### Thoughts on Confession [Page 83]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will  tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon in their hands. More  than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch. And  did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look down at her ring to  find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his  430 surprise. God's little joke. Then out she comes. Repentance skindeep.  Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Flowers,  incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation army blatant  imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting. How I found the  Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work. the whole  show. And don't they rake in the money too? Bequests also: to the P. P. for  the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses for the repose of my soul to  be said publicly with open doors. Monasteries and convents. The priest in  that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had  his answer pat for everything. Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the  440 church. The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of  it.</mark> [Page 83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=83&annotation=ZLUVUXFG)

> Bloom's thoughts about confession are cynical and detailed. He sees it as a powerful tool for the clergy ("Great weapon in their hands"). He imagines the whispered secrets ("Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch...") and the confessor's questions ("And did you chachachachacha?"). He thinks about the potential for secrets to be revealed ("Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke."). He sees repentance as superficial ("Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame."). He also contrasts Catholic practices (altar, flowers, incense) with those of the Salvation Army ("blatant imitation," "Reformed prostitute will address the meeting"). He views the Roman Catholic Church as a powerful, wealthy institution ("Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show," "rake in the money"). He mentions a legal case involving a priest and reflects on the Church's perceived authority and organized structure ("doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it").

### Noticing Unbuttoned Waistcoat [Page 83]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all  the time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a  (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.  Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me  before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south.</mark> [Page 83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=83&annotation=DIZQYJUF)

> Bloom notices his waistcoat buttons are undone and reflects on how women might see this but wouldn't point it out, contrasting it with how men might mention a minor flaw like lint ("fluff") or an unhooked skirt. He uses the phrase "Glimpses of the moon," which can refer to fleeting views of something hidden, particularly undergarments (related to Hamlet's ghost appearing only during "the dead vast and middle of the night"). This thought reveals his self-consciousness about appearance, his observations of gendered social interactions, and a touch of sexual curiosity.

### Thoughts on the Funeral [Page 83]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Bore this funeral affair. 0  well, poor fellow, it's not his fault.</mark> [Page 83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=83&annotation=WN2GJYD8)

> A simple, straightforward thought expressing Bloom's feeling that the funeral is tedious ("Bore this funeral affair") while also showing a touch of sympathy for the deceased, Paddy Dignam ("0 well, poor fellow, it's not his fault").

### Observing the Chemist [Page 84]
<mark class="hltr-green">The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he  seems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone.  The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then.  Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character.  Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his alabaster  lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid. Smell almost cure  you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack. He ought to physic himself a  bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow that picked an herb to cure  himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to be careful. Enough stuff here to 480  chloroform you. Test: turns blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose  of laudanum. Sleeping draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad  for cough. Clogs the pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy  where you least expect it. Clever of nature.</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=84&annotation=7IBWNTV2)

> Bloom observes a chemist (pharmacist) and his surroundings. He notes the chemist's appearance and smell ("Sandy shrivelled smell," "Shrunken skull," "old"). His thoughts associate the chemist with the historical practice of alchemy ("Quest for the philosopher's stone," "The alchemists"). He muses on the effects of drugs and the nature of remedies, listing various substances and medical terms ("herbs, ointments, disinfectants," "alabaster lilypots," "Mortar and pestle," Latin abbreviations for pharmaceutical ingredients, "Electuary or emulsion," "Simples," "chloroform," "laudanum," "Lovephiltres," "Paragoric poppysyrup"). He considers the bravery of early healers ("The first fellow that picked an herb...had a bit of pluck"). The cynical conclusion "Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it" reflects a view of medicine as paradoxical or even dangerous.

### Personal Care and Bathing Fantasy [Page 84]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to  her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.  Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles  and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood. One of  the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin. Leopold,  yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse. But you  want a perfume too. What perfume does your? Peau d'Espagne. That soo  orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Pure curd soap.  Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt  gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I.  Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with  pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be  rather glum.</mark> [Page 84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=84&annotation=V3MV5UKF)

> Bloom's thoughts on personal care and hygiene are triggered, possibly by the chemist's shop. He recalls a sensual memory of a Spanish-looking woman. He lists various home remedies for skin/beauty ("strawberries for the teeth," "nettles and rainwater," "oatmeal...in buttermilk"). He has a humorous, slightly confused thought about a royal figure having "only one skin." He thinks about perfumes ("Peau d'Espagne," "orangeflower water") and soaps. This leads to his anticipation of getting a bath ("Hammam. Turkish. Massage."), which becomes mixed with sexual fantasy ("Nicer if a nice girl did it.", "Do it in the bath."). The phrase "Water to water" has spiritual or symbolic connotations (connecting his bath to themes of rebirth or the sea). He contrasts the refreshing idea of the bath with the impending "glum" funeral.

### Baths as Mosque and Advertising Ideas [Page 85]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you  550 of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He  eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up  like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like a  wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.  Something to catch the eye.</mark> [Page 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=85&annotation=YUSDMM43)
- [N] commenting on ads, marketing advice

> Bloom compares the Turkish baths building to a mosque, linking his everyday activities to his Eastern fantasies. He then shifts to observing an advertisement for college sports, offering a detailed critique ("Damn bad ad") and suggesting improvements based on principles of visual appeal and symbolism (a wheel with spokes). This highlights his profession and ongoing interest in advertising and marketing.

### Bathing Fantasy with Allusion [Page 86]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle  tepid stream. This is my body.  He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of  warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and  limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:  his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, s10  floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid  floating flower.</mark> [Page 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=86&annotation=SCAH79ZE)

> Bloom anticipates his bath with sensual detail, describing the physical sensation and appearance of the water and his body. The phrase "This is my body" is a direct allusion to the words of Christ during the Last Supper, applied here in a mundane and slightly ironic context, connecting the cleansing bath to a form of personal ritual or transubstantiation. He imagines his body in the bath using imagery of rebirth ("womb of warmth") and sensuality ("lemonyellow," "navel, bud of flesh," "limp father of thousands," "languid floating flower"), blending the physical act with personal meaning and fantasy.

### Memory of Father's Suicide [Page 95]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The  360 room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the  slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots  giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks  on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose.  Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.  No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.</mark> [Page 95](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=95&annotation=M9GI9IGC)
- [N] Blooms dads suicide

> Bloom's thoughts turn to the memory of his father's death and the subsequent inquest. He recalls specific sensory details of the scene (the hotel room, the bottle, the light, the coroner) and the official verdict ("overdose," "Death by misadventure"). The mention of the letter addressed "For my son Leopold" highlights the personal impact of his father's suicide. The final fragmented thoughts ("No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.") express a sense of peace or release associated with death, contrasting with the pain of life.

### Morbid Fantasy about Coffin [Page 96]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Born! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy  Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large  for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now.  Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose  quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The  sphincter loose. Seal up all.</mark> [Page 96](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=96&annotation=7ZYRWREG)

> This is a disturbing, almost cartoonish, morbid fantasy about Paddy Dignam's coffin opening and the body falling out. Bloom's thoughts are graphic and practical, dwelling on the physical changes in the corpse ("Red face: grey now," "insides decompose quickly") and the methods used to prepare a body for burial ("close up all the orifices," "With wax"). This passage reveals a dark, unsentimental side of Bloom's contemplation of death and decay, contrasting the solemnity of the funeral with grotesque internal imagery.

### Murderer's Ground [Page 97]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,  tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully  condemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered.</mark> [Page 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=97&annotation=KN7KG7E7)

> Bloom and others pass a location associated with a murder case ("Murderer's ground"). The description evokes a sense of neglect and decay ("Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden," "Whole place gone to hell"). Bloom's thought "Wrongfully condemned" suggests this place or person was perhaps unfairly judged. The phrase "The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered" is a gruesome, almost mystical idea about perception, guilt, and the final image seen by the victim.

### Fascination with Murder [Page 98]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">They love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing  consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. 480  Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.  Murder will out.</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=98&annotation=MUE36TG3)

> Bloom reflects on the public's morbid fascination with sensational murder cases, listing the typical details reported in newspapers ("Man's head found in a garden," "Her clothing consisted of," "The weapon used," "Clues. A shoelace."). The phrase "Murder will out" is a proverb (used by Shakespeare in Hamlet), implying that truth or guilt will eventually be revealed. This passage highlights Bloom's observation of human nature and the media's role in feeding public appetite for the macabre.

### Mourners at the Gates [Page 98]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed  harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with  dirt and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.  Fish's face, bloodless and livid.</mark> [Page 98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=98&annotation=LP3XWQUF)

> Bloom observes mourners leaving the cemetery. His description is unsympathetic and critical, using harsh language ("Leanjawed harpy" - referencing a mythological monster, a bird-woman representing punishment) and noting unflattering details ("hard woman at a bargain," "bonnet awry"). He sees the girl's grief as potentially performative ("looking up at her for a sign to cry") and describes her face with cold, clinical terms ("Fish's face, bloodless and livid"). This reflects a moment of detachment or cynicism in his observation of human behavior, even in mourning.

### Thoughts on Widowhood [Page 99]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had  outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must  outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the  world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him.  For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who  knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on  550 a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in  the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All  for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance.  Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It  never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more  in her warm bed.</mark> [Page 99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=99&annotation=NIW4X9N3)

> Bloom's thoughts turn to the nature of widowhood and remarriage. He observes that one spouse must always outlive the other. He cynically considers conventional condolences ("Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For Hindu widows only" - referencing Sati, the illegal practice of widow burning in India, suggesting a dark humor about remarriage). He reflects on the changing social status of widows, referencing Queen Victoria's elaborate and long-lasting mourning for Prince Albert ("Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning"), contrasting it with her eventual, subtle return to color ("a few violets in her bonnet"). He sees a certain vanity even in mourning. The passage ends with a poignant contrast between the cold isolation of death and the warmth of the marital bed.

### Cynical Thoughts on Funeral Ritual [Page 100-101]
<mark class="hltr-green">Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem  mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.  Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the  gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.  What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the  place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas  round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who  was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's  lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins</mark> [Page 100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=WCTANCF7)
<mark class="hltr-green">sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff  of that and you're a cloner.  My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.  The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's  bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and  shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you  were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.  -Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.  The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be  620 better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course ...  Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed  up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What  harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh  batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth,  men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little  sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them  all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.  -In paradisum.  Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over  630 everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.</mark> [Page 101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=BL6C462D)
- [N] Bloom about the priest and funeral ritual

> Bloom observes the funeral mass and the priest's actions with cynicism and dark humor. He sees the Latin prayers as adding a sense of importance for the mourners. He has gross physical thoughts about the priest ("Eyes of a toad too," "swells him up," "Looks full up of bad gas") and a morbid memory about releasing gas from coffins ("bore a hole...to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff...and you're a cloner," possibly a variation of 'goner'). He detaches the ritual from genuine belief, seeing the priest's actions as rote performance ("It's all written down: he has to do it."). He notes the Latin prayers ("Et ne nos inducas in tentationem" - "And lead us not into temptation"; "In paradisum" - "Into paradise") and the server's response, followed by a somewhat prurient thought about boy servants. He reflects on the priest's repetitive task and the variety of corpses he blesses, seeing the ritual as simply putting them to "sleep." His final thought on the priest's job is dismissive: "Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something."

### Resurrection and the Body [Page 102]
<mark class="hltr-green">Mr Kernan said with solemnity:  - / am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man's inmost heart. 670  -It does, Mr Bloom said.  Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two  with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken  heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.  One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying  around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.  The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last  day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus!  And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow  mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps. Find 6so  damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull.  Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.</mark> [Page 102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=JY4GEF2P)

> Mr. Kernan quotes the Biblical phrase "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25), finding it emotionally moving. Bloom agrees verbally ("It does") but his internal thoughts are cynical and materialist. He reduces the "heart," the traditional "seat of the affections," to a mere "pump" that fails ("gets bunged up"). He dismisses the idea of physical resurrection after death, using morbid and darkly humorous imagery of scattered body parts ("mousing around for his liver and his lights") and decay ("Pennyweight of powder in a skull"). The pun "And he came fifth and lost the job" mocks the story of Lazarus. He contrasts the spiritual concept of resurrection with the physical reality of decomposition, concluding, "Once you are dead you are dead." He also briefly touches on units of measurement ("Troy measure").

### Love Among the Tombstones [Page 104]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">You  might pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the  tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life.  Both ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to 760  the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people.</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=L6IA67MQ)

> Bloom has a cynical, slightly prurient thought about the cemetery as a place to meet women, specifically young widows. He links this idea to romanticized notions ("Love among the tombstones. Romeo") but sees it as a "Spice of pleasure" derived from being "In the midst of death." He uses the proverb "In the midst of death we are in life" (adapted from the Book of Common Prayer) to express this juxtaposition. He imagines the dead being tormented by the sights and smells of the living ("Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving"), suggesting a cruel or perverse pleasure ("Desire to grig people," meaning to annoy or provoke).

### Decomposition and Persistence of Cells [Page 104]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, fiesh,  nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot  quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy  kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.  Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are go on 780  living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on feed  on themselves.</mark> [Page 104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=9NMCTSRZ)

> Bloom continues his morbid contemplation of physical decay in the cemetery. He graphically describes the process of decomposition in the soil ("corpsemanure," "green and pink," "tallowy," "cheesy," "black treacle oozing"). He then shifts to a pseudo-scientific thought about the biological persistence of cells after death ("the cells or whatever they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically"), finding a kind of morbid immortality in cellular decay.

### The Man in the Macintosh [Page 105]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?  Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to know who he is.  Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his  lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him  after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man  8to buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say  Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every  Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.  0, poor Robinson CrusoeI  How couldyou possib/y do so?</mark> [Page 105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=A85ACWQC)

> Bloom notices a mysterious stranger, the "man in the macintosh," whose identity intrigues him. This figure will reappear throughout the novel. His thoughts then drift to the solitary life and death, considering the necessity of burial ("get someone to sod him," meaning to bury him). He reflects on the act of burial as uniquely human (or shared with ants). He makes an allusion to Daniel Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe*, humorously speculating on Friday burying Crusoe and creating a wordplay based on the days of the week ("Every Friday buries a Thursday"). He concludes with fragmented lines from a song about Robinson Crusoe.

### Reflections on Death and Remembering [Page 106]
<mark class="hltr-green">Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will  go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must  be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone  else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then  darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would  you. like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid  all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower  eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his  feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's 850  doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman.  Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall I nevermore  behold thee? Barn! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit:  forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers.  Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole,  one after the other.  We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well  and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire  of purgatory.  Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do 860  when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning.  Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,  poor mamma, and little Rudy.</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=GW3ZBR8X)

> Bloom continues his thoughts on death, imagining the experience of dying ("the moment you feel," "damned unpleasant," "delirium"). He lists physical signs of approaching death and includes a dark, shocking thought about hastening someone's death ("Pull the pillow away and finish it off"). He references religious imagery ("Devil in that picture of sinner's death") and opera ("Last act of Lucia" - referencing the final, death scene in Donizetti's *Lucia di Lammermoor*). He reflects on how the dead are quickly forgotten ("People talk about you a bit: forget you"). He mentions the declining commemoration of Charles Parnell ("Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out"), a political figure whose legacy was complicated by scandal, linking personal oblivion to historical forgetting. He considers the religious concept of purgatory ("Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory," a twist on the idiom). He ends with a personal, poignant thought about his own burial plot and the memory of his mother and deceased infant son, Rudy.

### Confirming Death [Page 106]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">And if he was alive all the  time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.  Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to  pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the  coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days.  Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as 870  soon as you are sure there's no.</mark> [Page 106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=04FFTYWIZ)

> Bloom entertains a morbid, slightly fantastical thought about someone being mistakenly buried alive ("And if he was alive all the time?"). This leads him to consider methods for ensuring death, ranging from the traditional ("pierce the heart") to the absurdly modern ("electric clock or a telephone in the coffin"). He thinks about the practicalities of burial ("Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer") and concludes with a pragmatic, if gruesome, desire to be certain before burial.

> A brief, sharp sensory detail describing the visual appearance of a spade blade. The invented word "blueglancing" captures the specific way light reflects off the metal surface. This kind of precise observation is characteristic of Bloom.

### Remembering the Dead by Voice [Page 108-109]
<mark class="hltr-green">Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well,  the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.

> Bloom reflects on the difficulty of remembering the dead over time. He considers different aspects that trigger memory (eyes, walk, voice) and fixes on voice as particularly evocative. He fantasizes about using a gramophone to preserve the voices of the deceased, imagining the distorted sound ("Kraahraark!"). He compares this to how photographs preserve faces. This passage shows his imaginative approach to death and memory, finding practical (if impractical) technological solutions for emotional needs. He brings the thought back to a specific, less significant memory ("some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely's"), demonstrating the mundane nature of memory.

### Decay, Cremation, and Foreign Customs [Page 109]
<mark class="hltr-green">One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the  bones clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is  meat gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that  V(D'ages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.  Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm.  Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime  feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea.  Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water.  Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But  being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the air however. Out of a flying  990 machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.  Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be  surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before he's well dead.  Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite  crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEHD2VX6)

> Bloom continues his morbid thoughts on dealing with dead bodies. He compares corpses to "meat gone bad" and cheese to "Corpse of milk," using stark, reductive metaphors. He recalls a detail from a book about Chinese perceptions of the smell of white people's corpses. He considers different disposal methods: cremation (noting priests' opposition, mockingly calling them "Devilling for the other firm"), plague pits, lethal chambers, burial at sea, and the Parsee practice of leaving bodies for birds ("tower of silence"). He lists elements associated with disposal (Earth, fire, water). He touches on the drowning experience ("See your whole life in a flash"). His thoughts wander to fantastical notions like burying bodies from a flying machine or underground communication among the dead. He observes the practical reality of flies appearing quickly on corpses and ends with a graphic, sensory description of a decaying body.

### Rejecting the Afterlife for Life [Page 109]
<mark class="hltr-green">I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost  after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world  after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more  do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let  them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings.  Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.</mark> [Page 109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=VPW4K8S6)

> Bloom dismisses common ideas about the afterlife, ghosts, and hell. He quotes a line about a dislike for the afterlife, potentially from a letter or something he read ("I do not like that other world she wrote"). He firmly rejects the idea of death and focuses on the present life ("Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you"). He prefers the physical reality of life and warmth ("Warm beds: warm fullblooded life") to the cold, decaying state of death ("maggoty beds"). This is a strong assertion of his embrace of physical existence over abstract or religious notions of what comes after.

### Draymen Rolling Barrels [Page 111]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince's stores and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince's stores.</mark> [Page 111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/03N2FW96K)

> This sentence describes the action of draymen moving barrels from a store to a brewery float. It is notable for its use of chiasmus (a rhetorical device where phrases are repeated in reverse order) and repetition ("Grossbooted draymen," "rolled barrels," "dullthudding," "Prince's stores," "brewery float"). This stylistic choice mimics the repetitive, mechanical nature of the labor being described and draws attention to the language itself.

### Machines Ruling the World [Page 113]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines.  Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.</mark> [Page 113](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0YJL5U8L6)

> Bloom connects the recently deceased Dignam to the idea of "Machines" ruling the world, reflecting on the power and potential destructiveness of machinery. He then applies this concept to the human body ("His machineries are pegging away too"), seeing internal biological processes ("fermenting," "Working away, tearing away") as a kind of uncontrolled mechanism. The image of the "old grey rat tearing to get in" is ambiguous but suggests decay, hunger, or some destructive force associated with the body.

### Newspaper Content and Advertising [Page 113]

- [N] Description of a typical newspaper edition

> Bloom's thoughts catalog the various types of content found in a newspaper, focusing on what he believes actually sells copies: "ads and side features," not dry official news ("stale news in the official gazette," exemplified by the idiom "Queen Anne is dead," meaning old news). He lists official notices, recreational features (nature notes, cartoons, specific comic strips like "Pat and Bull story"), children's content, advice columns ("good cure for flatulence?"), and visual items ("Mainly all pictures," "Shapely bathers"). He expresses interest in the advice column ("I'd like that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note."), suggesting his desire to connect and share knowledge. He mentions the printer Cuprani and notes the commercial success of visually-driven content.

### Printing Machine Sounds [Page 115]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Silt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its fiyboard with slit the first batch of quirefolded papers. Slit. Almost human the way it silt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door too slit creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way. Slit.</mark> [Page 115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0ALHS8LHW)

> Bloom observes the sounds and actions of the printing press. He focuses on the specific sound "Slit," which he repeats. He personifies the machine and a door, seeing them as "Almost human" and "Doing its level best to speak," suggesting that even inanimate objects have a form of communication or presence ("Everything speaks in its own way."). The repetition of "Slit" emphasizes the distinct sound of the machine cutting the paper.

### Stephen's Vampire Poem [Page 124]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.</mark> [Page 124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/086QBUJBR)
- [N] Stephen's poem he wrote on the torn letter corner

> This is the short poem Stephen wrote on the torn corner of Mr. Deasy's letter (recalled from page 55). It uses vivid, slightly unsettling imagery ("swift sail flaming," "pale vampire") and focuses on a physical, intense encounter ("Mouth to my mouth"). The "pale vampire" image is open to interpretation, possibly representing death, a draining relationship, or a darker aspect of desire.

### Irish Identity and Language [Page 125]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.  Material domination. Domine! Lord! Where is the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!</mark> [Page 125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0VT89DQNV)

> Professor MacHugh, in the library, speaks about Irish national character, suggesting a historical inclination towards supporting "lost causes." He contrasts Irish intellect and imagination with English pragmatism and materialism ("time is money," "Material domination"). He expresses frustration with teaching Latin, which he sees as the language of the dominant, materialistic English ("a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money"). He contrasts this with Greek, which he implies represents spirituality or higher thought. The sequence "Domine! Lord! Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury?" plays on the religious invocation of "Lord" versus the political figure Lord Salisbury, highlighting the perceived gap between spiritual and secular power.

### Hamlet Allusion [Page 129]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">And in the porches of mine ear did pour.</mark> [Page 129](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0JS75N7Z2)

> This is a direct quote from Shakespeare's *Hamlet* (Act 1, Scene 5). It is spoken by the Ghost of Hamlet's father, describing how he was murdered by Claudius pouring poison into his ear while he slept. This line is significant to Stephen's Shakespeare theory about paternity and betrayal. Its appearance here, possibly recalled by Stephen or MacHugh, reinforces its importance in the literary discussion.

### Stephen's Egyptian Parable (Part 1) [Page 131]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once .more.  Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet. He began: -Mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remark.I addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my 830 learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far</mark> [Page 131](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/09LBW57H7)

> This is the beginning of Stephen's extended speech in the library (the Scylla and Charybdis episode). He adopts a formal, oratorical style, addressing an imagined audience ("Mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen"). The preceding internal thought about his eyes and "Witless shellfish" suggests a moment of intense focus or perhaps a slight detachment before he begins speaking. He frames his speech as a response to a remark by "my learned friend" (likely MacHugh or another person present).

### Stephen's Egyptian Parable (Part 2) [Page 132]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses. His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let our crooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself? -And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me</mark> [Page 132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0R84AB46S)

> Stephen continues his parable, setting it in "ancient Egypt." He imagines an Egyptian highpriest speaking to the youthful Moses, contrasting the power and pride of Egypt with the humble state of the Israelites. The description of the listeners' cigarette smoke "ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech" is a brief, poetic image within the narrative of the speech itself, linking the mundane present activity to the elevated historical narrative.

### Stephen's Egyptian Parable (Part 3) [Page 132]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">FROM THE FATHERS</mark> [Page 132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0E42CIFIG)

> This brief line appears within Stephen's speech, possibly indicating a source or section heading he is referencing, likely from theological or philosophical texts ("The Fathers" often refers to early Christian theologians).

### Stephen's Egyptian Parable (Part 4) [Page 132]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That's saint Augustine. -W~ will you Jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity. 850 Nile.  Child, man, effigy. By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.  -You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it 860 boldly: -But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.  He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.</mark> [Page 132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/04A75LTSI)

> Stephen delivers the core of the highpriest's speech, which contrasts the material wealth, power, and ancient culture of Egypt with the perceived poverty, lack of history, and "obscure" religion of the Jewish people. He quotes Saint Augustine ("those things are good which yet are corrupted..."), connecting the ancient conflict to philosophical ideas about good and evil. The speech is a thinly veiled allegory for Ireland's relationship with England and the struggle against cultural and political dominance. Stephen then gives Moses' response, emphasizing his rejection of this arrogant worldview as the act that allowed him to lead his people to freedom and receive the Law, highlighting the power of spiritual resistance over material subservience. The phrase "language of the outlaw" refers to Hebrew, suggesting it was marginalized by the dominant Egyptian culture.

### Myles Crawford's Crude Interruption [Page 136]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">K. M. R. I. A. -He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him. While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily.</mark> [Page 136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0VGUD7323)

> Myles Crawford, the newspaper editor, reacts crudely and loudly to Stephen's high-minded speech. His vulgar phrase "He can kiss my royal Irish arse" provides a stark contrast to Stephen's intellectual discourse, representing a more earthy, anti-intellectual Irish sensibility. The abbreviation "K. M. R. I. A." stands for the phrase. Bloom observes this interaction, suggesting his presence and perspective in this scene.

### Dublin Trams and Traffic [Page 137]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedra wn, rapidly.</mark> [Page 137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0KE249SZE)

> This passage provides a detailed, almost catalog-like description of Dublin street traffic. It highlights the paralysis caused by stalled tramcars ("becalmed in short circuit") and contrasts it with the rapid movement of other horse-drawn vehicles. The listing of specific Dublin place names and vehicle types creates a strong sense of realism and place, immersing the reader in the city's environment on June 16, 1904.

### Owning Water and the Stream of Life [Page 141]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good for ads.</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0YPIGXM7Q)

> Bloom observes something related to advertising and water, leading him to question the abstract concept of owning a natural resource like flowing water ("How can you own water really?"). He links the ever-changing nature of a stream to the philosophical idea that "life is a stream" (alluding to Heraclitus's philosophy). He then brings the thought back to his profession, noting that diverse locations are suitable for advertising.

### Jargon and Big Words [Page 141]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.</mark> [Page 141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0UP4PERZB)

> Bloom's brief, critical observation on the use of complex language ("big words") to describe simple things. He suggests this is done purely for effect ("on account of the sound"), perhaps reflecting on jargon, pretentious language, or even the stylistic excesses he encounters in writing.

### Bloom's Advertising Ideas [Page 142]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't 140 stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kanse/1, sold by Hely's Ltd, 8 5 Dame street.</mark> [Page 142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/073978FR3)

> Bloom recounts some of his innovative, visually-driven advertising ideas ("transparent showcart with two smart girls writing letters") that were rejected, believing they would have been successful due to appealing to curiosity. He contrasts his ideas with what he sees as poor advertising placements ("Plumtree's potted under the obituaries," "cold meat department") and bad slogans ("You can't lick 'em. What? Our envelopes." - a confusing double meaning). He includes a short, fictional dialogue advertising an eraser ("Kanse/1, sold by Hely's Ltd"), mimicking the style of advertising jingles or sketches. His frustration stems from his ideas not being adopted and others' lack of creativity, often attributed to petty reasons like not thinking of it first.

### Memory of Milly's Bath and Father's Work [Page 143]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper. Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night.  American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.</mark> [Page 143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0QP36KICT)

> Bloom drifts into a nostalgic memory of a happier time, focusing on domestic details: a "snug little room" with red wallpaper, the cost of the wallpaper, and the weekly routine of his daughter Milly's bath night. He recalls sensory details like the smell of her bathwater and notes her appearance ("Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too."). The thought shifts to photography and his father's profession as a daguerreotypist, suggesting that his own visual interests (like advertising) might be an "Hereditary taste."

### Smells of the Restaurant [Page 144]
<mark class="hltr-green">Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.</mark> [Page 144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/02SANBQGG)

> Bloom is assaulted by the strong smells coming from Harrison's restaurant ("Hot mockturtle vapour," "steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly," "heavy noonreek"). These smells trigger thoughts about the ingredients needed for good baking. He observes a "barefoot arab" (likely an impoverished person) inhaling the fumes, speculating that they might be trying to alleviate hunger ("Deaden the gnaw of hunger"). He questions whether this experience is "Pleasure or pain." The detail about chained cutlery ("Knife and fork chained to the table") highlights the cheap, basic nature of the "Penny dinner" offered there.

### Mrs. Purefoy's Husband's Nightmare and Postcard [Page 144-145]
<mark class="hltr-magenta">-Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.  Indiges. -Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs. -The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said. She took a folded postcard from her handbag.  -Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</mark> [Page 144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0JJC8IB6T)
<mark class="hltr-magenta">-What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U. P.? -U. p: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great shame for them whoever he is.  260 -Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</mark> [Page 145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0FLCJJMMZ)

> Bloom encounters Mrs. Purefoy (or someone reporting on her husband), who describes her husband's nightmare about "the ace of spades was walking up the stairs." The ace of spades is traditionally associated with death or bad luck. She then shows Bloom a postcard simply marked "U. P." She interprets it as someone making fun of or provoking her husband ("Someone taking a rise out of him"). While seemingly a minor detail, "U.P." is open to interpretation and may relate to the planned meeting between Boylan and Molly ("Up" as in the game is up, or possibly referencing 'Up Parnell'). Bloom's reaction is sympathetic.

### Thoughts on Childbirth and Social Schemes [Page 147]
<mark class="hltr-green">Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a shoe she 380 had so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.</mark> [Page 147](zotero://en/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=147&annotation=ZWZY59HI)

> Bloom's thoughts focus on the pain and difficulty of childbirth, likely triggered by hearing about Mrs. Purefoy's prolonged labor. His description is visceral and empathetic ("groaning," "belly swollen out," "Child's head too big," "trying to butt its way out"). He expresses relief that Molly had an easier experience and wishes for an invention to alleviate childbirth pain. He mentions "Twilight sleep" (a form of anaesthesia) used by Queen Victoria. He contrasts these practical concerns with what he sees as meaningless poetic language ("the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on."). His mind then shifts to a complex, detailed financial scheme for providing a sum of money to every child born, demonstrating his interest in social welfare and practical calculations, contrasting starkly with the abstract poetic phrase he dismissed.

### Observing Police Officers [Page 148]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts.  Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in 4 to pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.</mark> [Page 148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0X8CZNVVG)

> Bloom observes a group of police officers marching. His description is critical and somewhat mocking, focusing on their physicality ("Foodheated faces, sweating helmets," "fat soup under their belts") and comparing their movements to animals or military maneuvers ("Indian file. Goosestep," "Let out to graze," "Prepare to receive cavalry."). He parodies a line from a song ("Policeman's lot is oft a happy one," from Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Pirates of Penzance*), adding an ironic twist. The repeated military-style phrases related to food ("Prepare to receive soup," "Bound for their troughs") reduce the officers to simple, base needs, reflecting a dismissive view of authority.

### Thoughts on Politicians and Public Speaking [Page 149]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used 440 to. Whether on the scaffold high.  You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom. Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language question should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease 410 before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.</mark> [Page 149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/077GCZBU4)
<mark class="hltr-yellow">His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed 480 groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes.</mark> [Page 149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0YKXE4ZGY)

> Bloom's thoughts combine observations of young people ("Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling") potentially involved in politics or demonstrations (allusions to Vinegar Hill, a historical battle site associated with rebellion; the Butter Exchange band). He cynically predicts their future conformity ("magistrates and civil servants," joining the army). He mentions the patriotic song "Whether on the scaffold high," associated with Irish martyrs. He then reflects on political figures, contrasting Parnell's "fascination" with Arthur Griffith's perceived lack of charisma ("no go in him for the mob"). He dismisses political rhetoric as "gas about our lovely land. Gammon and spinach" (an idiom for nonsense). He pictures political discussions happening in tearooms and debating societies, focusing on typical Irish political debates (republicanism, language vs. economic questions). His thoughts turn to the social aspect, imagining people (like parents) using hospitality ("Stuff them up with meat and drink") to influence young enthusiasts. He caricatures their behavior and uses food imagery ("Michaelmas goose," "goosegrease"). He mockingly thinks about their entitled attitude ("The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world"). The phrase "Homerule sun rising up in the northwest" is geographically incorrect for a sunrise and possibly symbolic of the flawed or unrealistic nature of the Irish Home Rule movement. The second part of the highlight shifts his mood and focus, as a cloud covers the sun, leading him to reflect on the unchanging, repetitive nature of life despite all the activity and talk ("Useless words. Things go on same, day after day"). He lists the cyclical events of the city (police, trams) and the personal cycles of life and death (Dignam's funeral, Mrs. Purefoy's labor, births and deaths happening constantly).

### Birth and Death Cycle [Page 150]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0I8X59TRH)

> Bloom continues his reflection on the constant cycle of birth and death. He uses a colloquialism for dying ("kicked the bucket"). He juxtaposes the numbers of people dying and being born. The phrase "washed in the blood of the lamb" is a religious allusion (Revelation 7:14, referring to salvation through Christ), applied ironically to the physical cleansing of newborns. The onomatopoeia "bawling maaaaaa" combines the sound of a crying baby with the bleating of a lamb, linking birth to both innocence and sacrifice in a darkly humorous way.

### The City and Transience [Page 150]
<mark class="hltr-green">Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. 490 Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter, for the night.  No-one is anything.</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/09GXHNNYT)

> Bloom contemplates the city as a constantly changing entity, with generations of people ("Cityful passing away, other cityful coming"). He thinks about property and ownership, noting that buildings change hands but the concept of the "landlord" persists. He suspects a "Swindle in it somewhere" related to wealth accumulation. He compares the city's structures, built up and then decaying, to ancient civilizations and their monumental remnants (Pyramids, Chinese Wall, Babylon, Round towers). He contrasts the permanence of ancient stones with the ephemeral nature of modern, poorly constructed buildings ("jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses"). The reflection culminates in a sense of transience and meaninglessness regarding individual identity ("No-one is anything.").

### The Twoheaded Octopus [Page 150]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which 520 the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. The tentacles ....</mark> [Page 150](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0LRAX7G8W)

> This is a metaphorical description, likely spoken by Stephen Dedalus or another character in the library scene, possibly referring to a complex person (perhaps Buck Mulligan or Haines) or entity. The image of a "twoheaded octopus" suggests something multifaceted or contradictory. One head is associated with stagnation or waiting for apocalyptic events ("ends of the world have forgotten to come"), while the other has a specific, identifiable characteristic ("speaks with a Scotch accent," likely referring to Haines). The thought trails off, leaving the nature of the "tentacles" ambiguous.

### Literary People and Poetry [Page 151]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.  Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood. The dreamy cloudy gull 550 Waves o'er the water.r dull.</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0XLDDAI8K)

> Bloom notices a woman's appearance (loose stockings), which he finds unappealing. This triggers a train of thought about "literary etherial people," whom he characterizes negatively ("Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes"). He speculates humorously that their diet might influence their poetic output, contrasting them with a policeman who eats "Irish stew," implying such a person is incapable of poetry. He seems to mock the idea that poetry requires a specific, perhaps effete, disposition. He ends by quoting or parodying a bad, clichÃ©d line of poetry ("The dreamy cloudy gull Waves o'er the water.r dull"), reinforcing his critical view of a certain type of aestheticism.

### Thoughts on the Moon and Memory [Page 152]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/07STD8KHS)
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon. She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. 590 Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.  Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/06KRXSLJA)
<mark class="hltr-yellow">I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed.  Could never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding 610 water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then.  Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.</mark> [Page 152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0DCYTKCD2)

> Bloom's thoughts on astronomy ("Gasballs spinning about") lead him to dismiss the vastness of space as ultimately meaningless repetition ("Same old dingdong always"). He follows a speculative cosmic cycle ("Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around"). The thought of the moon triggers a memory of Molly ("she said") and the moon's phase. This leads to a more detailed, bittersweet memory of a past evening walk with Molly ("Walking down by the Tolka," "The young May moon she's beaming, love" - quoting a song by Thomas Moore). The memory is sensual and physical ("Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.") but ends abruptly, perhaps because it's painful or reminds him of loss. He then reflects explicitly on the past and present self ("I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I?"), pinpointing the change in their relationship to moving house ("When we left Lombard street west something changed") and especially the death of their infant son, Rudy ("Could never like it again after Rudy"). He muses on the irreversibility of time ("Can't bring back time. Like holding water in your hand."). A sudden domestic thought interrupts ("Wants to sew on buttons for me"), bringing him back to the present and his need to respond to a request from Molly.

### Escape Fantasy and Sensual Memories [Page 153]
<mark class="hltr-green">Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.  High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim. Wealth of the world. A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.  640 Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then. He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds. -Jack, love! -Darling! -Kiss me, Reggy! -My boy! -Love!</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0QEAKWVCN)

> Following his reflection on the past, Bloom acknowledges the futility of dwelling there ("Useless to go back"). His thoughts then shift to a desire for escape and sensual indulgence, triggered by sounds and images ("High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses"). He fantasizes about acquiring wealth and luxury ("All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa," "Wealth of the world"). "Agendath Netaim" (Plantation Society) was a Zionist group buying land in Palestine, linking this fantasy to his Jewish identity and a longing for a homeland or prosperity, possibly for Molly. This leads to explicit sensual and erotic thoughts ("warm human plumpness," "Perfume of embraces," "hungered flesh," "Kissed, yielded...along sofas, creaking beds") and imagined romantic dialogue ("-Jack, love!"). These fantasies occur as he walks towards the Burton restaurant, driven by hunger, blending his need for physical sustenance with deeper longings. The sounds of horses and harness bells ("Jingling, hoofthuds") seem to pursue or accompany these thoughts.

### Observing Diners in the Burton [Page 153]
<mark class="hltr-green">His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See the animals feed. Men, men, men. Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: 660 halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0E8QAZITL)

> Bloom enters the Burton restaurant and is immediately overwhelmed by the smells ("Stink," "pungent meatjuice"). His observation of the diners is critical and dehumanizing; he sees them as animals feeding ("See the animals feed. Men, men, men."). He describes their eating habits with disgust, focusing on messy, gluttonous behavior ("swilling, wolfing gobfuls," "eyes bulging," "shovelled gurgling soup," "spitting back on his plate," "halfmasticated gristle"). His thought about "New set of microbes" reflects his concern for hygiene. This passage vividly portrays Bloom's alienation from the scene and his fastidious nature.

### Thoughts on Eating and Sacrifice [Page 154]
<mark class="hltr-green">from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn't swallow it all however.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0WHGIYCRI)

> Bloom continues observing the diners, noting their hurried eating ("Bolting to get it over"). He briefly reflects on himself ("Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us.") and uses common idioms ("Hungry man is an angry man," "Bitten off more than he can chew"). His thought about a discarded bone leads to an allusion to Cormac Mac Airt, a legendary Irish king. The anecdote, likely from a school text ("schoolpoem"), describes Cormac choking to death. Bloom's retelling humorously connects the physical act of choking on food with the historical/religious narrative of Saint Patrick attempting to convert him ("Couldn't swallow it all however" is a pun, linking swallowing food to accepting Christianity).

### Restaurant Smells and Disgust [Page 154]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Smells of men. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, 670 reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale of ferment. His gorge rose. Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing up stewgra vy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0JIDRLP99)

> Bloom is overwhelmed by the unpleasant combination of smells in the restaurant, focusing on bodily odors and stale substances ("Smells of men," "Spaton sawdust," "reek of plug," "spilt beer," "men's beery piss," "stale of ferment"). This visceral reaction causes him physical nausea ("His gorge rose"). He continues to observe the diners with disgust, caricaturing their actions ("sharpening knife and fork," "picking his tootles," "Scoffing up stewgra vy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man!"). He uses idioms ("chewing the cud," "Look on this picture then on that" - referencing Hamlet's ghost comparing Claudius to King Hamlet). His intense revulsion leads him to decide to leave ("Get out of this.").

### Conversation with Mouth Full [Page 154]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0Z74GV9AB)

> Bloom observes a conversation between two diners, focusing on the physical act of speaking while eating ("telling him something with his mouth full"). He parodies the muffled, indistinct sound of speech in this state ("I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday," meaning something like "I munched him on the Ulster Bank on Monday"). This provides a moment of comic realism and highlights the less refined aspects of social interaction.

### Thoughts on Food, Decay, and Class [Page 155]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces, young one. Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.  730 Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/03LJE47BM)

> Bloom continues his broad contemplation of food, beginning with a consideration of vegetarianism and the flavors of vegetables. He then shifts to the production of meat, with visceral and somewhat disturbing descriptions of animal slaughter ("Pain to the animal too," "poleaxe to split their skulls open," "Flayed glasseyed sheep"). He lists various meat dishes or cuts ("Staggering bob," "Bubble and squeak," "brisket," "Rawhead and bloody bones") and notes the sight of carcasses ("Butchers' buckets wobbly lights," "sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust"). He touches on the idea of blood as a tonic ("Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline") and ends with the chilling image of "Famished ghosts" perhaps craving this life-giving substance. This passage is a dense collection of sensory details, empathy for animals, and thoughts on the raw reality of meat consumption.

### Food, Discovery, and Class [Page 158-159]
<mark class="hltr-green">Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you 860 off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation.

> After drinking wine, Bloom's thoughts on food become more expansive and associative. He surveys the variety of foods people eat and ponders their origins and how they were discovered (from shells, trees, the ground, the sea). He humorously questions who first decided to eat things like oysters ("Unsightly like a clot of phlegm," "Garbage, sewage they feed on") and notes their reputed aphrodisiac effect ("Aphrodis"). He connects oysters to a place he visited ("Red Bank this morning") and a common saying about the season ("June has no ar no oysters"). He thinks about preferences for "high" or tainted game ("Tainted game. Jugged hare"). He considers exotic foods (Chinese aged eggs) and elaborate meals ("Dinner of thirty courses"), linking them to wealth and aristocratic habits ("The elite. Creme de la creme. They want special dishes to pretend they're."). He contrasts this with ascetic diets ("Hermit with a platter of pulse") and the practical reality of obtaining food (venison rights, the butcher). He describes kitchen scenes and fancy menu items ("Curly cabbage a la dllchesse de Parme"). He considers the effects of too many different foods or ingredients ("Too many drugs spoil the broth"). He momentarily imagines being a waiter in a fancy hotel, interacting with wealthy patrons ("halfnaked ladies"), and uses a playful dialogue involving a potential pun on a French-sounding name ("miss Dubedat," "Yes, do bedad"). He ends by thinking about the fish trade and the wealth accumulated by seemingly uneducated people ("old Micky Hanlon of Moore street...can't write his name on a cheque...worth fifty thousand pounds"), contrasting status and wealth with origin and manners. This long internal monologue covers a vast range of topics related to food, culture, class, and human appetites.

### Memory of Molly on Howth [Page 159]
<mark class="hltr-green">Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden 900 under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky.  The bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. 0 wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum.  Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. 9 to Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.  Me. And me now. Stuck, the flies buzzed.</mark> [Page 159](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0ZTY42XLM)

> This is Bloom's most famous and sensual memory, recalling an intimate encounter with Molly on Howth hill. The description is highly sensory, detailing the sights (colors of the bay, sky), sounds (silence), and touch ("Coolsoft with ointments," "hand touched me, caressed," "Pillowed on my coat"). A central, slightly unusual detail is Molly giving him a piece of chewed seedcake ("seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle"), which he ate, experiencing "Joy." This act is both tender and slightly off-putting, blending intimacy with bodily fluids. The memory moves into more explicit details of their physical encounter ("Ravished over her I lay," "kissed her mouth," "woman's breasts full...fat nipples upright," "Hot I tongued her"). The presence of a goat is a momentary, slightly surreal interjection, common in Joyce's style. The memory is intense and clearly significant to Bloom, representing a peak moment of connection and sensuality with Molly. It ends abruptly, pulled back to the less pleasant reality of the present ("Stuck, the flies buzzed.").

### Ideal vs. Physical Body [Page 159]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung,</mark> [Page 159](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/09JEN9UDV)

> Bloom contrasts idealized, divine concepts of sustenance and beauty ("Nectar," "gods' food," "Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian" - referencing Juno, Roman goddess of marriage and childbirth, known for beauty) with the crude reality of human digestion and excretion ("stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung"). This reflects a tension in his mind between elevated, aesthetic ideals and the undeniable, often unlovely, functions of the physical body.

### Desire to See Anatomy [Page 160]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never 930 looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop.  See if she.</mark> [Page 160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0XX3EMLBW)

> Following the thought on digestion, Bloom continues the comparison of the body to an engine that needs fuel. His internal monologue shifts to a voyeuristic desire to observe female anatomy, seemingly resolving to attempt this ("I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop. See if she."). This reveals his persistent sexual curiosity and willingness to act on it when he thinks he can get away with it.

### Fantasies about Internal Anatomy [Page 162]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.</mark> [Page 162](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0Y48ZDPIK)

> Bloom's morbid and scientific curiosity leads him to fantasize about being able to literally see inside the human body, watching food travel through the digestive system. He combines anatomical terms ("biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines") with grotesque imagery ("swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after") and acknowledges the impracticality and horror of the idea ("poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show"). His final thought "Science" dryly labels this macabre contemplation as a form of inquiry.

### Helping the Blind Man and Pondering Senses [Page 163-164]
<mark class="hltr-green">Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired drudge get his 11 oo doze. That's right. Clear.

- [N] Bloom helps the blind man across the street and ponders

> Bloom encounters a blind man and helps him cross the street. His thoughts become an extended, empathetic, and curious meditation on the experience of being blind. He observes the man closely, noting his appearance and behavior ("Stains on his coat," "Slobbers his food," "Like a child's hand"). He speculates on how the blind perceive the world, considering heightened senses (touch, smell, hearing) and other forms of perception ("sense of volume," "something blacker than the dark"). He wonders about their mental maps of the city ("Queer idea of Dublin"). He thinks about the skills blind people develop ("Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Embroider. Plait baskets.") and reflects on societal prejudice. His thoughts become sensual again as he imagines how a blind person would perceive a woman through touch ("Kind of a form in his mind's eye. The voice, temperatures...when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves."). He feels pity for the man ("Poor young fellow!"), questions the justice of such suffering ("Where is the justice being born that way?"), and links it to other tragedies, like the General Slocum steamboat disaster ("Holocaust"). He touches on philosophical/religious concepts like Karma and reincarnation ("metempsychosis," distorted to "met him pike hoses") but ultimately expresses a feeling of detachment or inability to fully comprehend their experience.

### Stephen's Philosophical Definitions [Page 168]
<mark class="hltr-green">Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.</mark> [Page 168](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0R774CRE2)

> This passage contains Stephen's fragmented, poetic, and philosophical pronouncements in the library. He calls for clear definitions ("Unsheathe your dagger definitions"). He parodies scholastic philosophy with "Horseness is the whatness of allhorse" (referencing the philosophical problem of universals). He offers unconventional, sensory-based definitions: "God: noise in the street: very peripatetic" (linking God to the sounds of life and Aristotle's followers, who lectured while walking); "Space: what you damn well have to see." He includes a difficult allusion to William Blake ("Through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity") which relates to perception, the infinite, and the physical body. He concludes with a key statement about time and existence: "Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past."

### Definition of a Ghost [Page 169]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-What is  ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.</mark> [Page 169](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0D6LX4SHR)

> Stephen offers a definition of a ghost that goes beyond simple physical death. He includes "absence" and "change of manners" as ways in which someone (or something) can fade into impalpability, suggesting that ghosts can be figures from the past who are no longer present in the current social or cultural landscape. This definition is relevant to his Shakespeare theory about the ghost of Hamlet's father and also to the idea of historical figures and traditions fading away.

- [N] See bloomsday book p 64 for details, interesting allusion and pun

> This is a fragmented internal monologue from Stephen. He asserts his independence ("I paid my way"). His thoughts jump to someone from the northeast ("He's from beyant Boyne water"), perhaps Haines. He thinks about debt ("You owe it. Wait. Five months."). He then returns to philosophical ideas about identity and change: though his physical body changes constantly ("Molecules all change. I am other I now"), his essential self persists through memory ("But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms"), referencing Aristotle again ("entelechy, form of forms"). He lists religious actions ("sinned and prayed and fasted") and recalls a memory involving Father Conmee. The concluding "I, I and I. I. A. E.1. 0. U." emphasizes the self and uses the vowels, possibly symbolizing creation or Stephen's artistic identity (as seen in his earlier work, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*).

- [N] Jargon of theosophists

> Bloom observes a meeting of Theosophists ("Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers"), a spiritual movement drawing from various Eastern and Western traditions. His description is a blend of factual details (location, "Isis Unveiled" - a book by Helena Blavatsky) and cynical or humorous interpretations of Theosophical terms ("Pali book," "Aztec logos," "astral levels," "oversoul, mahamahatma," "chelaship," "pineal glands aglow," "Buddh under plantain"). He sees the leader as a "Gulfer of souls, engulfer" and describes the followers ("Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls") being absorbed into the movement with dramatic, sound-based language ("wailing creecries"). This passage mocks the jargon and perceived affectations of the group.

### Library and Thoth [Page 174]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.

- [N] The librarians room

> Stephen reflects on the books in the library, seeing them metaphorically as "Coffined thoughts," "mummycases," or "embalmed in spice of words," suggesting that recorded knowledge is preserved but perhaps also dead or static. He thinks of Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing, knowledge, and libraries ("birdgod," often depicted with an ibis head, "moonycrowned" due to his association with the moon god Khonsu), linking the library's function to ancient beliefs about knowledge. He recalls a line from his earlier Egyptian parable ("And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest"), placing his own intellectual pursuits within this historical and mythological context. He describes the library setting ("In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks"), perhaps referencing tiled walls or the binding of books.

### Artist as Weaver and Enduring Identity [Page 174-175]
<mark class="hltr-green">-As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where</mark> [Page 174](zotero://en/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=174&annotation=043AGCLJI)
<mark class="hltr-green">it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff 380 time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</mark> [Page 175](zotero://en/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=175&annotation=0ES44UDED)

> Stephen elaborates on his theory of the artist. He uses the metaphor of weaving ("weave and unweave our bodies") to describe both physical change (the constant renewal of cells, likened to "mother Dana," a Celtic goddess associated with the land and origin) and the artistic process ("so does the artist weave and unweave his image"). He uses his own body, specifically a mole, as an example of something that remains constant despite physical change, suggesting an enduring essence. This leads to his core idea about artistic paternity and identity: the artist (father) is revealed through their creation (the "image of the unliving son"). He incorporates an allusion to Percy Bysshe Shelley ("when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal" - from *A Defence of Poetry*), linking intense creative moments to a fleeting, dying state. He reflects on the nature of identity across time, seeing past, present, and future selves as connected ("that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be").

### Shakespeare, Separation, and Reunion [Page 175]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">-There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering. Said that.  400 -If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre? Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.  -A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/0RZTCZ78V)

> Stephen discusses themes of separation and reconciliation, particularly in Shakespeare's plays. He suggests that true reconciliation can only follow a separation or "sundering." He links the dark themes of Shakespeare's great tragedies (King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida) to underlying personal events in the author's life. He then contrasts these with the more optimistic later plays, using *Pericles, Prince of Tyre* as an example. He alludes to both Ulysses and Pericles as figures who suffer "shipwrecked in storms dire." The "redconecapped" description of Pericles refers to a specific visual detail from the play's opening. The resolution for Pericles comes with the rediscovery of his lost daughter, Marina, symbolizing reunion and healing ("A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina."). This supports Stephen's broader theory that Shakespeare's life is reflected in his works.

### Stephen's Shakespeare Theory and Paternity [Page 176-177]
<mark class="hltr-yellow">--That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr 450 Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (a ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannisrn will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is 460 worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.  They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.  -The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the</mark> [Page 176](zotero://en/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=176&annotation=0H8CXCC98)
<mark class="hltr-yellow">manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs 470 that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, 480 a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</mark> [Page 177](zotero://en/library/items/2GJVZGHQ?page=177&annotation=06LXZUS3W)
- [N] "The true Shakespeare made known only in his  playsâ€”of which he is the only begetter; the true Shakespeare to be made  known only in the â€˜unlivingâ€™ son Hamnet; the true Bloom to be made  known only in the discovery of Stephenâ€”and the re-emergence of unliving Rudy; the true Stephen to be made known only in the unwritten masterpiece; God made known only in His only begotten Son, consubstantial  with Him: this is the mystery of paternity, reflected in artistic creation" (B 67)

> This is the climax of Stephen's elaborate Shakespeare theory, focusing on Shakespeare's life and the theme of paternity as reflected in *Hamlet*. He references Goethe's saying ("Beware of what you wish for in youth..."). He speculates on Shakespeare's personal experiences of betrayal or disappointment influencing his plays, particularly linking the poison in the ear motif in *Hamlet* to something that "wounded him there where love lies ableeding." He suggests Shakespeare retreated into his art ("weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself"). He defines Shakespeare at this point as a "ghost, a shadow," who is revealed only through his creation, *Hamlet*, which is his "unliving son." The theory culminates in the theological concept of "consubstantial," arguing that the son (Hamlet, and by extension Hamnet, Shakespeare's deceased son) is of the same substance as the father (Shakespeare). Stephen sees this as the "mystery of paternity" reflected in artistic creation. He references specific details from Shakespeare's poems and plays related to bodies and moles (Lucrece, Imogen). The line "And in the porches of their ears I pour" echoes the Ghost's line from Hamlet, placing Stephen in the position of imparting knowledge, perhaps even poison, to his listeners.

> This line signals the end of Stephen's lengthy and intense theoretical performance. The response "Amen!" is a religious affirmation, used here ironically to punctuate Stephen's quasi-theological argument. It is spoken by Buck Mulligan, who appears at the door, breaking the intellectual tension of the library scene with his characteristic dramatic flair and interruption.
