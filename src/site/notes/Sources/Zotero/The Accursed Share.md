### id0QFWCS9D7

<mark class="hltr-yellow">I had a point of view from which a human sacrifice, the construction of a church or the gift of a jewel were no less interesting than the sale of wheat. In short, I had to try in vain to make clear the notion of a "general economy" in which the "expenditure" (the "consumption") of wealth, rather than production, was the primary object.</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=5&annotation=QFWCS9D7)

### id0IIG4PW6S

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Indeed, the ebullition I consider, which aQimates the globe, is also my ebullition. Thus, the object of my research cannot be disÂ­ tinguished from the subject at its bOiling point. In this way, even before finding a difficulty in receiving its place in the common moveÂ­ ment of ideas, my enterprise came up against the most personal obstacle, which moreover gives the book its fundamental meaning.</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=6&annotation=IIG4PW6S) 

### id0DTLZTM2X

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Writing this book in which I was saying that energy finally can only be wasted, I myself was using my energy, my time, workÂ­ ing; my research answered in a fundamental way the desire to add to the amount of wealth acquired for mankind. Should I say that under these conditions I sometimes could only respond to the truth ofmy book and could not go on writing it?</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=7&annotation=DTLZTM2X)

### id0QMA9P7U2

<mark class="hltr-magenta">And yet that is the crucial analysis that alone can adequately circumscribe the opposition of two political methods: that of fear and the anxious search for a solution, combining the pursuit of freedom with the imperatives that are the most opposed to freeÂ­dom; and that of freedom of mind, which issues from the global resources of life, a freedom for which, instantly, everything is resolved, everything is rich - in other words, everything that is comÂ­mensurate with the universe. I insist on the fact that, to freedom of mind, the search for a solution is an exuberance, a superfluity; this gives it an incomparable force. To solve political problems becomes difficult for those who allow anxiety alone to pose them.  It is necessary for anxiety to pose them. But their solution demands at a certain point the removal of this anxiety. The meaning of the political proposals to which this book leads, and that I fonnuÂ­late at the end of the volume, is linked to this lucid attitude.</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=10&annotation=PCLWW8UC)

### id0PWD7WBL4

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Economic pheÂ­nomena are not easy to isolate, and their general coordination is not easy to establish. So it is possible to raise this question conÂ­cerning them: Shouldn't productive activity as a whole be considÂ­ ered in terms of the modifications it receives from its surroundings or brings about in its surroundings? In other words, isn't there a need to study the system of human production and consumption within a much larger framework?</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=13&annotation=PWD7WBL4) 

### id0XADUI4PD

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In overall industrial development, are there not social conÂ­flicts and planetary wars? In the global activity of men, in short, are there not causes and effects that will appear only provided that the general data of the economy are studied? Will we be able to make ourselves the masters of such a dangerous activity (and one that we could not abandon in any case) without having grasped its general consequences? Should we not, given the constant develÂ­ opment of economic forces, pose the general problems that are linked to the movement of energy on the globe?</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=13&annotation=XADUI4PD)

### id0758FM5KF

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Is the general determination of energy circulating in the biosphere altered by man's activity? Or rather, isn't the latter's intention vitiated by a determination of which it is ignorant, which it overlooks and cannot change?</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=14&annotation=758FM5KF) 

### id0L2BXC4P9

<mark class="hltr-green">Man's disregard for the material basis of his life still causes him to err in a serious way. Humanity exploits given material resources, but by restricting them as it does to a resolution of the immediate difficulties it encounters (a resolution which it has hastily had to define as an ideal), it assigns to the forces it employs an end which they cannot have. Beyond our immediate ends, man's activity in fact pursues the useless and infinite fulÂ­fillment of the universe. 1</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=14&annotation=L2BXC4P9) 
- [N] Man uses resources to solve immediate issues via a utilitarian lens, like survival, hunger, scarcity, restricted economy, but wrongly uplifts this to an ideal, ignoring the excess. Beyond these immediate ends, man pursues to spend the excess, dissipate the accursed share in alignment with cosmic flows, through art, war, ritual, luxury, non-productive expenditure, We mustn't ignore the dissipation of this excess or else it has the potential to be catastrophic, this is the study of the general economy. 

### id0EZXXIZCD

<mark class="hltr-green">The living organism, in a situaÂ­tion determined by the play of energy on the surface of the globe, ordinarily receives more energy than is necessary for maintainÂ­ ing life; the excess energy (wealth) can be used for the growth of a system (e.g., an organism); if the system can no longer grow, or if the excess cannot be completely absorbed in its growth, it must necessarily be lost without profit; it must be spent, willÂ­ingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSTYR758?page=14&annotation=EZXXIZCD)
