> [!abstract]+  
> **abstract**: This article examines the ideological divergence between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, two prominent figures in the 19th-century socialist movement, whose differences shaped the trajectory of revolutionary thought. The study explores how their conflicting philosophical foundations‚ÄîMarx's emphasis on historical materialism and the role of the state in achieving communism, versus Bakunin's anarchist insistence on the immediate abolition of the state and a decentralized, anti-authoritarian approach‚Äîled to profound disputes within the First International. By analyzing their views on authority, freedom, and the means of revolutionary change, the paper illuminates the enduring tensions between Marxism and anarchism, offering insights into the challenges of achieving unity in anti-capitalist movements.

> [!tldr]- Hypothesis  
> **hypothesis**:: The conflict between Marx and Bakunin arose primarily from their fundamentally opposing philosophies on authority and the role of the state, which reflect deeper ideological divides between Marxism and anarchism.

### Marx and Bakunin's Mutual Disdain

<mark class="hltr-yellow">According to Marx, Bakunin was ‚Äúa man devoid of all theoretical knowledge‚Äù and was ‚Äúin his element as an intriguer‚Äù,1 while Bakunin believed that ‚Äú...the instinct of liberty is lacking in him [Marx]; he remains from head to foot, an authoritarian‚Äù.2</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=3&annotation=W7Q26ICJ) 

- [N] Marx viewed Bakunin as theoretically lacking and an intriguer
- [N] Bakunin saw Marx as authoritarian and lacking the instinct for liberty

### Differing Views on the State and Revolution

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Marx envisioned a transitional stage between capitalism and a fully mature commu-nist society, which included a state in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., a workers‚Äô state), Bakunin adamantly rejected the establishment of any kind of state, including a workers‚Äô state. In fact, this rejection is the defining principle of the school of anarchism, a term that literally translates as ‚Äúno government‚Äù. For Bakunin, the only consistent, revolutionary option was to move immediately to a fully mature communist society which, both authors agreed, would be distinguished by the absence of a state. As a corol-lary to this disagreement, Marx supported attempts by independently organized workers to pursue their class interests by pressing for reforms within the bourgeois state ‚Äî for example, for a reduction in the length of the working day ‚Äî arguing that such victories would promote class consciousness, whereas Bakunin con-tested this proposal on the grounds that any political engagement whatsoever would constitute a perversion</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=3&annotation=BD5TLR6D) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">of the revolutionary movement and instead advocated complete abstention from the bourgeois political arena. The proper form of a revolutionary organization was also a point of dispute. Bakunin enthusiastically created secret societies as catalysts for a revolutionary upsurge while Marx flatly rejected them. Finally, the two contested the proper role of the peasants in a revolutionary movement. Bakunin argued that they might play a leading role while Marx designated the proletariat as the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent.</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=4&annotation=KLVTDIHC) 
- [N] Marx advocated for a transitional "dictatorship of the proletariat" state
- [N] Bakunin rejected any state, advocating for immediate stateless communism
- [N] Marx supported political engagement for reforms, Bakunin rejected it
- [N] Bakunin favored secret societies, Marx rejected them
- [N] Bakunin saw potential in peasants, Marx prioritized the proletariat

### Bakunin's Naturalistic Philosophy of Morality and Freedom

<mark class="hltr-blue">The moral law...is indeed an actual law...because it emanates from the very nature of human society, the root basis of which is to be sought not in God but in animality.7</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=6&annotation=K2VR2ZI9) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">justice is a natural human sentiment which permanently resides in the human constitution.</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=6&annotation=JNUL5T6K) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">‚ÄúWe must distinguish well between natural laws and authoritarian, arbitrary, political, religious, criminal, and civil laws which the privileged classes have established....‚Äù10</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=6&annotation=AJ8999N5) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">for Bakunin, acting freely means, above all, acting ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù or according to one‚Äôs natural impulses: ‚ÄúThe liberty of man consists solely in this: that he obeys natural laws because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been externally imposed upon him by any extrinsic will whatever, divine or human, collective or individ-ual.‚Äù11 In other words, this definition rests on the conception of humans as natural creatures governed by natural laws. To act naturally is simply to be spontaneous, to be ‚Äúoneself‚Äù: Once more, Life, not science, creates life; the spontaneous action of the people themselves alone can create liberty.12</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=6&annotation=GFPM8ARQ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">I am a fanatical lover of liberty....I do not mean that formal liberty which is dispensed, meas-ured out, and regulated by the State....Nor do I mean that individualist, egoist, base, and fraudulent liberty extolled by the school of Jean Jacques Rousseau and every other school of bourgeois liberalism, which considers the rights of all, represented by the State, as a limit for the rights of each....No, I mean the only liberty worthy of the name, the liberty which implies the full development of all the material, intellectual, and moral capacities latent in everyone of us; the liberty which knows no other restrictions but those set by the laws of our own nature. Consequently there are, properly speaking, no restrictions, since these laws are not imposed upon us by any legislator from outside, alongside, or above ourselves. These laws are subjective, inherent in ourselves; they constitute the very basis of our being....[T]hat liberty of each man which does not find another man‚Äôs freedom a boundary but confirmation and vast extension of his own; liberty through solidarity, in equality.15</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=7&annotation=DNLCWFP3) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Bakunin is basi-cally arguing that it is our nature to live together in equality, cooperating with one another, where no one exploits or is exploited.</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=7&annotation=XW7DBYAI) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">To summarize Bakunin‚Äôs philosophy, he is operating, by and large, within the naturalistic framework estab-lished by the empiricist current of the Enlightenment. Humans are conceived as embodying a permanently fixed nature with behavior basically determined by natural laws. This state of affairs is then identified with what is good. However, when coercion enters into the relations among people, we enter the realm of the unnatural. We are alienated from our natural condition, and we lose our freedom</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=7&annotation=DAEEHMXD) 
- [N] Bakunin's morality is rooted in natural human society not God
- [N] Justice is an inherent human sentiment
- [N] Natural laws are distinct from authoritarian laws
- [N] Freedom is acting naturally according to one's own recognized natural laws
- [N] True liberty is the full development of human capacities, free from external restrictions
- [N] Cooperation and equality are natural
- [N] Bakunin's philosophy is rooted in Enlightenment empiricism where a fixed human nature is governed by natural laws

### Marx's Dialectical Philosophy of Historical Development

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Hegel rejected the Enlightenment conviction that humans are a natu-ral species, conforming to the same kind of permanently fixed laws as the rest of the natural world. Instead, he postulated a vision of humanity engaged in a developmental process, constantly transforming and recre-ating itself in its struggle to become increasingly rational. Moreover, this undertaking was conceived as a collective endeavor since rationality, in the final analysis, is an attribute that requires, both for its original emergence and its continual exercise, the contribution of the entire species.</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=8&annotation=DTGEBMNW) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social con-sciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their exis-tence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.17</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=8&annotation=ZRKLYVM3) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">man must be in a position to live in order to be able to ‚Äòmake history.‚Äô But life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things. The first historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs, the production of material life itself. The second point is that the satis-faction of the first need...leads to new needs; and this production of new needs is the first historical act.18</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=8&annotation=LEEC5ZL7) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">While Bakunin posited a fixed, natural human essence, Marx, again following Hegel‚Äôs lead, believed that human nature itself unfolded in a developmental process whereby the specific nature of one historical epoch was shed and a new nature was donned in a perpetual process of re-creation. As humans invent ever more sophisticated instruments to employ in the production process, they simultaneously transform themselves into more rational, universal individuals</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=9&annotation=FBY2SS2Y) 
- [N] Marx, following Hegel, saw humanity as engaged in a developmental process of increasing rationality
- [N] Social existence, not consciousness, determines human consciousness
- [N] Production of material life is the first historical act, and the creation of new needs is the second
- [N] Human nature is not fixed but develops historically

### Marx's View on Revolution, Ethics, and Freedom

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In stark contradiction to Bakunin, Marx believed that a successful revolution does not signal the recapturing of an original, natural essence that was stifled by the advent of the State and the creation of classes, but rather the creation of a new human being</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=10&annotation=FRN8HNZJ) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Bakunin adopted a static version of human nature, identifying it with what is physically natural while Marx posited a humanity that was undergoing maturation, leaving behind a more animal-like existence as it achieved ever higher levels of rationality and self-consciousness.</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=10&annotation=I94CBYEE) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">While Bakunin defined the good in terms of what is ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù Marx relativized ethical terms historically so that each new mode of production was seen to spawn new ethical assumptions</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=10&annotation=P4FKICLP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">for Marx, freedom does not amount to following one‚Äôs impulses or engaging in spontaneity. Impulses are a part of one‚Äôs natural constitution ‚Äî they are not the product of choice. When we act impulsively, we act ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù and without conscious reflection. However, when we rationally and consciously direct our behavior, we ourselves, through thoughtful deliberation, determine our course of action</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=11&annotation=ZNJ83D48) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">connected with the first point, freedom is not a capacity that is exercised fundamentally by an individual; rather it is for Marx undertaken primarily by a community of people</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=11&annotation=NI5PMW8G) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">But the goal of a socialist society is to invert this relatio. Instead of individuals feeling powerless in the face of their own social institutions, by di-rectly coming together nthrough organized discourse, they place themselves in a position to alter these institutions according to their own needs and values. But this can only be accomplished when individuals are operating as a coordinated force, where they are discussing, debating and voting on which options to pursue, and where everyone has the opportunity to participate</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=12&annotation=EAEZ5FHZ) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">in Marx‚Äôs opinion, a superior conception: the collective, rational determination of social policy. ‚ÄúFreedom in this field can only consist in socialized man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by blind forces of Nature.29</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=12&annotation=WFVKPY43) 
- [N] Marx viewed revolution as creating a new human being, not reverting to a natural state
- [N] Bakunin saw human nature as static, Marx viewed it as developing towards rationality
- [N] Marx saw ethics as historically relative, not based on what is "natural"
- [N] Marx believed freedom is rational, conscious action not following impulses
- [N] Freedom is a communal, not individual, capacity
- [N] Socialism allows individuals to collectively alter social institutions
- [N] True freedom is the collective, rational determination of social policy

### The Interplay of Circumstances and Human Action

<mark class="hltr-blue">Marx postulated a dynamic relation between human intentions and the surrounding economic environment: Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.32It shows that circumstances make men just as much as men make circumstances.33</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=13&annotation=F7QBH8IL) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal....We pre-suppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construc-tion of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality.34</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=13&annotation=JQ493U2C) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Marx insisted upon drawing a sharp boundary between nature, on the one hand, and history on the other: Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour-power. This relation has no natural basis, neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods. It is clearly the result of a past historical development, the product of many economic revolutions, of the ex-tinction of a whole series of older forms of social production.35</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=14&annotation=PE4BNV5W) 
- [N] Humans make history within the constraints of their circumstances
- [N] Human labor is distinct from animal labor through conscious planning
- [N] Social relations are not natural but are the product of historical development

### The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

<mark class="hltr-yellow">From Bakunin‚Äôs perspective, the most important revolutionary act aimed at the destruction of the institution of the State: ‚ÄúWe think that the necessarily revolutionary policy of the proletariat must have for its immediate and only object the destruction of States.‚Äù37 The State, by establishing the right of inheritance, creates economic classes and thereby introduces an ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù dimension in human relations, a perversity, as it were, that can only be maintained through force which, by means of the military and the police, the State monopolizes. When the State is abolished and coercion is removed, people can immediately revert back to their ‚Äúnatural‚Äù condition and recapture their ‚Äúnatural‚Äù freedom. No transitional period is required. The dic-tatorship of the proletariat, as another State, would only serve to repeat the mistakes of the past.</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=15&annotation=73N5AWZV) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">according to Marx, if the proletariat is truly determined to suc-ceed, it must be prepared to use decisive force, if the situation demands. Therefore the working class must establish its own coercive apparatus, i.e. state, so that it can defend its interests and enforce a genuine form of majority rule. Otherwise it will find itself at the mercy of a counterrevolution.</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=15&annotation=FUSGVMDU) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The determination to smash the bourgeois state was a cornerstone of Marx‚Äôs political program. Its destruction opens the door to the political participation of the entire working class where everyone can have a voice in shaping public policy</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=16&annotation=EKPNXWFN) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">...after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labour, has vanished; after labour has be-come not only a means of life, but life‚Äôs prime want, after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of coopera-tive wealth flow more abundantly ‚Äî only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banner: ‚ÄòFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!‚Äô47</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=17&annotation=JCL7QB7W)

### Organizational Differences and the Role of the Masses

<mark class="hltr-blue">This association stems from the conviction that revolutions are never made by individuals or even by secret societies. They come about of themselves, produced by the force of things, the tide of events and facts....All that a well-organized secret society can do is first to assist the birth of the revolution by sowing ideas corresponding to the instincts of the masses, then to organize, not the army of the revolution ‚Äî the army must always be the people ‚Äî but a kind of revolutionary general staff made up of devoted, hardworking and intelligent men, and above all of sincere friends of the people, without ambition or vanity, and capable of acting as intermediaries between the revolutionary idea and the popular instinct. Therefore there should be no vast number of these individuals....Two or three hundred revo-lutionaries are enough for the largest country‚Äôs organization.48</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=18&annotation=69PTX489) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">First, the emphasis is placed on the instincts of the masses for the fuel that will erupt in a revolutionary upheaval. Second, there is no emphasis on organizing the masses themselves. Third, the secret societies act somewhat as midwives, assisting in the birth of the revolution but are certainly not considered the main engine of it. They engage in translating the instincts of the masses into revolutionary concepts. Fourth, precisely because these societies are in fact secret, they are not elected by the masses, but are self-appointed representatives of the masses. They themselves determine whether they are genuinely hardworking and intelligent</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=18&annotation=ZV2WKYRF) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Marx completely ignores a most important element in the historic development of humanity, that is, the temperament and particular character of each race and each people, a temperament and a character which are themselves the natural product of a multitude of ethnological, climatological, economic and historic causes....Among these elements...there is</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=18&annotation=FKD4UX5V) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">one whose action is completely decisive in the particular history of each people; it is the intensity of the spirit of revolt....This instinct is a fact which is completely primordial and animalistic....[I]t is a matter of temperament rather than intellectual and moral character....49</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=19&annotation=I977MKRH) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">In order to mount a revolution, Bakunin‚Äôs self-appointed leaders must simply mix with the oppressed so that this instinct to revolt might be ignited. Then, because instincts are true and just, one can depend on them entirely to push the revolution to a successful conclusion</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=19&annotation=7HSZFAZT) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">without class consciousness, members of the proletariat assume that their miserable condition is a function of their own individual initiative, or lack thereof, or simply bad luck, as opposed to resulting from naked class exploitation. But class consciousness is not simply gained instinctively since the bourgeoisie, for example, is relentlessly on a campaign to assert ideological hegemony by arguing that capitalism represents the highest achievement in individual freedom, fairness in the distribution of wealth, etc</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=19&annotation=ALLLLB7V)

### The Importance of Working-Class Organization

<mark class="hltr-blue">But in order for education to take place, the working class must be organized, and one such venue is the trade union movement: ‚ÄúIt is in trade unions that workers educate themselves and become socialists, because under their very eyes and every day the struggle with capital is taking place.‚Äù52</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=19&annotation=ZHM8IMDP) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">A political party is the organ through which the working class develops and expresses its class consciousness. It is the instrument with which it articulates and promotes its own class interests in opposition to the bourgeoisie</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=19&annotation=STQDM2LF) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">the proletariat must see to it: I. that no groups of workers are barred on any pretext or by any kind of trickery on the part of local authorities or government commissioners. II. that everywhere workers‚Äô candidates are put up alongside the bourgeois-democratic candi-dates, that they are as far as possible members of the League, and that their election is promoted by all possible means. Even where there is no prospect whatever of their being elected, the workers must put up their own candidates in order to preserve their independ-ence, to count their forces and to lay before the public their revolutionary attitude and party standpoint. In this connection they must not allow themselves to be bribed by such arguments of the democrats as, for example, that by so doing they are splitting the democratic party and giving the reactionaries the possibility of victory.52a</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=20&annotation=DJ33EUGC) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">In all appropriations up to now, a mass of individuals remained subser-vient to a single instrument of production; in the appropriation by the proletarians, a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual, and property to all. Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals, only when controlled by all.53</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=20&annotation=X3EDCKWE) 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">while Bakunin was intent on organizing secret societies and relying on the instincts of the masses to push the revolution to a successful conclusion, Marx was urging that the workers themselves become organized. These working class organizations not only serve as vehicles for education, but they have the potential to become powerful weapons aimed at challenging the bourgeoisie for state power. In the process of this struggle, workers not only deepen their self-consciousness as an oppressed class, but gradually acquire the realization that they are capable of seizing control of society and running it in their own interests.</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=20&annotation=7T66D9HX)

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Bakunin consistently condemned all efforts on the part of the proletariat to improve its lot by pressing for specific legislation that seemed in its interest. The State, after all, was an unnatural excrescence, implying that any participation in it would only contaminate the revolutionary movement. Marx, on the other hand, not only regarded this political engagement as permissible but even, at times, as indispensable, provided that the conquest of state power was not on the immediate agenda, either because the objective conditions were lacking or because the proletariat had not already achieved the appropriate level of class consciousness and organization</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=21&annotation=XSS2YQT3) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">every movement in which the working class as a class confronts the ruling classes and tries to constrain them by pressure from without is a political move-ment. For instance, the attempt by strikes, etc., in a particular factory or even in a particular trade to compel individual capitalists to reduce the working day, is a purely economic move-ment. On the other hand the movement to force through an eight-hour, etc. law is a political movement. And in this way, out of the separate economic movements of the workers there grows up everywhere a political movement, that is to say, a class movement, with the object of enforcing its interests in a general form, in a form possessing general, socially coercive force.54</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=21&annotation=TRWJTQAK)

### The Revolutionary Agent and the Role of the Peasants

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Another strategical disagreement dividing Marx and Bakunin centered around the question of who would lead the revolution. Both agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the peasants and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=22&annotation=3BHCEEHP) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">By flower of the proletariat, I mean precisely that eternal ‚Äòmeat‚Äô,...that great rabble of the people (underdogs, ‚Äòdregs of society‚Äô) ordinarily designated by Marx and Engels in the picturesque and contemptuous phrase lumpenproletariat. I have in mind the ‚Äòriffraff‚Äô, that ‚Äòrabble‚Äô almost unpolluted by bourgeois civilization, which carries in its inner being and in its aspirations...all the seeds of the socialism of the future....56</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=22&annotation=RGSVVXNY) 

<mark class="hltr-blue">Marx consistently argued that the proletariat alone was the revolutionary agent: ‚ÄúOf all classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.‚Äù57</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=22&annotation=IDPRVAVF) 

<mark class="hltr-red">Because Marx believed human nature was shaped by the economy, he analyzed the possible revolutionary agents by analyzing how the economy would influence their development. And economic considerations led him to conclude that the peasants could not play a leading revolutionary role</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=22&annotation=6IJXSSYI) 

<mark class="hltr-red">Marx also believed that the situation of the peasants, not only prohibited them from attaining class consciousness, but from becoming a truly revolutionary class: The small holding peasants form a vast mass, the members of which live in similar condi-tions but without entering into manifold relations with one another. Their mode of produc-</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=22&annotation=T3QQA8RV) 

<mark class="hltr-red">tion isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse....Their field of production, the small holding, admits of no division of labor in its cultivation, no application of science and, therefore, no diversity of development, no variety of talent, no wealth of social relationships. Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient; it itself directly produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with society. A small holding, a peasant and his family; alongside them another small holding, another peasant and another family....In so far as millions of families live under economic conditions of existence that sepa-rate their mode of life, their interests and their culture from those of other classes, and put them in hostile opposition to the latter, they form a class. In so far as there is a merely local interconnection among these small-holding peasants, and the identity of their interests be-gets no community, no national bond and no political organization among them, they do not form a class.58</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=23&annotation=869SEIR5)

### Differing Definitions of Human Nature and Freedom

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We can now see that when Marxists and anarchists refer to such concepts as ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù and ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù, they have diametrically opposed definitions in mind and therefore are frequently talking at cross-purposes. Bakunin‚Äôs notion of spontaneity stands starkly opposed to Marx‚Äôs notion of collective, rational action</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RTRFAJRY?page=24&annotation=FETV6JVF) 
- [N] Marxists and anarchists have opposing definitions of human nature and freedom
- [N] Bakunin's spontaneity is opposed to Marx's collective
