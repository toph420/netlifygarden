> [!abstract]+  
> **abstract**:: In Oppose Book Worship (1930), Mao Zedong critiques the dogmatic reliance on books and textual authorities, emphasizing the importance of integrating theory with practical experience. Mao argues that blind adherence to written texts can lead to rigid thinking and detachment from real-world conditions, which are dynamic and varied. He stresses that knowledge is not static and must be derived from and tested through direct engagement with the realities of the masses. Maoâ€™s essay is a call for revolutionary thinkers to use books as tools rather than ultimate authorities, encouraging flexibility, innovation, and critical thinking to adapt Marxist principles to Chinaâ€™s unique social and political context.

> [!tldr]- Hypothesis
