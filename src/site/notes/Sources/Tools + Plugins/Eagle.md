# Eagle

- [Open Eagle](eagle://)

## Summary

Eagle is a great tool for collecting inspiration and offers a wide variety of options for categorizing and accessing saved images and videos.


## Notes

- I'm able to include photos using the "Copy File Path" option in Eagle, but what happens if the file moves (why would it?). On the other hand, if I let Eagle handle the links then moving files around isnt a problem, see below:
	- `<img src="app://local/Users/topher/Pictures/My Eagle Library.library/images/KW7ZX5YA6VMWU.info/IMG_7111.png">`
	- <img src="app://local/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/My Eagle Library.library/images/KW7ZX5Y3F3Q8Y.info/IMG_6452.png">
	- Example of an eagle link: [Link](eagle://item/KW7ZX5YA6VMWU)
- Maybe the move is to use both, that way if the file does move at least I can find that file and re link it. BOOM:
	-  <img src="app://local/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/My Eagle Library.library/images/KW7ZX5Y3F3Q8Y.info/IMG_6452.png"> [Permalink](eagle://item/KW7ZX5Y3F3Q8Y)
- Use Espanso text expansion macro `: img` without the space and it expands to an image with the clipboard contents, which is the full path to the image from the "Copy Path" command from Eagle 
	- <img src='app://local//Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/My Eagle Library.library/images/KXHMKYCVBPLMA.info/IMG_9253.png'> [Permalink](eagle://item/KXHMKYCVBPLMA)
- Another option is to drag the image into obsidian from eagle, but this creates duplicates because obsidian will copy the file to the attachments.
