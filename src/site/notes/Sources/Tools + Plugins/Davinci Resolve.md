> [!Abstract]- Templates, Presets, Macros, PowerBins, and PowerGrades

> **Q:** How do I make a project preset?
> 
> **A:** If you just need project settings, you can make a project settings preset from the three dots menu in Project Settings>Master Settings. These can persist across all projects in a database/library.
> 
> If you need a project with a set bin structure, you can make a "template" project and then just File>Save As... when you need a new project from that template.
> 
> **Q:** How do I save a transition preset?
> 
> **A:** Get your transition settings just right, then right-click on it in the timeline and select "Create Transition Preset." These can persist across all projects in a database/library.
> 
> Custom Fusion transitions can be saved as Macros in certain paths (coming soon).
> 
> **Q:** How do I save a color grading preset?
> 
> **A:** You can save a "still" of a certain grade in a "gallery" to use across a project, or in a special type of gallery called a "powergrade gallery" to use across a database. Regular galleries persist across all timelines in a project, and PowerGrades persist across all projects in a database/library.
> 
> **Other Common Preset Types**
> 
> * Edit
>    * Adjustment Clips - put effects you want to reuse on an adjustment clip and drag it to a bin for reuse later
> * Fairlight
>    * Track layout presets - useful in creating the required tracks for your mix, also available in the New Timeline dialogue box on the Edit page
>    * Sound Effect Libraries (and Foley Sampler) - easily search and find sound effects in your library from the Fairlight page
>    * Track insert/effect presets - save your reverb/pitch shift settings to easily recall them in other projects
> * Fusion
>    * Macros - can be Transitions, Generators, Titles, or Effects for use on Edit page or Fusion page, depending on where they're saved
> * Deliver
>    * Render Settings - Deliver page settings that persist across all projects in a database/library
> * Miscellaneous
>    * PowerBins - bins that persist across all projects in a database/library
>    * Data Burn-In Presets - useful for the Deliver page and for client review sessions
>    * Input Sizing Presets - useful for matching dailies to a framing chart easily
