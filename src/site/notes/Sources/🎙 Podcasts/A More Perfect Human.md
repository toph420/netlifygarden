> The dream of AI ‚Äî artificial intelligence ‚Äî has been around for centuries: the idea of an intelligent machine without free will popped up in ancient Taoist scrolls, Buddhist fables, and the tales of medieval European courts. But it wasn't until the 20th century that science caught up to our imaginations.  Today, AI is everywhere. Breakthrough technologies like ChatGPT make news, while less glamorous but more ubiquitous programs are woven into every part of our lives, from dating apps to medical care. In many ways, AI  is  the invisible architecture of modern life. It's a reality that's both mundane and terrifying. And it's accelerating at a rapid rate, even as we still grapple with some of the most fundamental questions it raises about what, if anything, is uniquely human. In this episode, we explore the tension between our love of AI and our fear of it ‚Äî and try to decode the humans behind the machines.

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Art is a product of the human mind and is a way to project our hopes, fears, and dreams onto the canvas of the invisible unknown.
2. The divine gift of art comes from our own mind.

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Dr. Collins is a scientist who is interested in understanding the basic molecular level of human beings, and beyond that.
2. The discovery of the structure of DNA was a major milestone in human understanding, and it opened up new possibilities for understanding who we are.
3. Dr. Collins believes that further unlocking the secrets of human genetic programming will be essential in understanding who we are as a species.

> **Speaker 6**
> So much of the driving force behind Collins' work is trying to understand what makes humans human, like at the most basic molecular level, but also beyond that. Growing up in the 1950s, he was amazed by the recent discovery of the structure of DNA.

> **Speaker 4**
> There were covers of Life magazine saying, discovering the secret of life.

> **Speaker 5**
> Was it actually discovering the secret of life?
>
> **Speaker 4**
> It's maybe a little over the top because I actually think there's more to life than just molecules, but certainly if you want to talk on a biological basis of life, yeah, this was discovering that. It's kind of the book of life that's inside each cell. It's incredibly inspiring to think about this, and it is the same kind of molecule that all living things on this planet use. Another reason to be pretty sure that we're all descended from some common ancestor, and that as this information molecule evolved over time, it took on different letters and different orders, but it was still that double helix with all of that potential.
>
> **Speaker 8**
> Potential.

> **Speaker 6**
> Part of what this discovery did was show us humans a way into understanding things about ourselves we hadn't yet discovered. And Collins believed to further unlock the secrets of who we are, we needed to decode our genetic programming.

> These machines produced massive amounts of heat and noise, and working with them, you had to carry these boxes of punch cards back and forth as input and output and stick it into the machine. This is like a sweatshop. Everything was really slow, very different from the machinery that we're all used to today, which is almost as fast as light and, you know, conforms to our every demand. You know, the most disturbing part of the history of AI for me comes from the fact that these men who are working in artificial intelligence looked at those massive, noisy, hot, mainframe computers and saw themselves in it. They looked at them and identified a deep affinity that there was something fundamentally shared between their minds and these machines.

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, factories started popping up across the world reshaping the nature of work.
2. Charles Babbage, English mathematician, was touring factories in the context of industrialization and thinking, wow, these factories can tell us something about the human mind because they tell us about how processes can be broken down and what the elementary steps even of thought might be.
3. This devaluation of the classes of people and or machines who do this sort of repetitive mechanical broken down labor in service of efficiency and profit maximization in industrialization and early capitalism led to the rise of the proletariat.

> And it's such a confident moment in American academia. After the war, there was more money, there were more people, there was more cultural capital, more political capital for science and technology than ever before. There's also a real concern about the practicalities of preventing a nuclear war which was a very real threat at that time. We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous. That's why these children are practicing to duck and cover. We hope it never comes but since it may be used against us, we must get ready. Nuclear detente and in particular mutually assured destruction rely very specifically on information processing capability. You need to know where your enemies nuclear. Arsenal's are, you need to know if you've been attacked or that you were about to be.

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. There was only one running computer program at the conference, and it was the logic theory machine developed by Alan Newell and Herbert Simon at the Rand Corporation.
2. This machine enshrined a particular vision of the human mind, in which human minds and modern digital computers are fundamentally the same.
3. One proposed measure of machine intelligence is something called the Turing test, named for its creator British mathematician Alan Turing.
4. If you're determining whether something is a machine or a human being, the Turing test is based on a parlor game for swapping gender.

> There was exactly one running computer program that was operational and presented at the conference and it was the logic theory machine that had been developed by Alan Newell and Herbert Simon at the Rand Corporation. And it enshrined a particular vision of the human mind. Herbert Simon is famous for saying that human minds and modern digital computers are quote-unquote species of the same genus. They are fundamentally the same, just a symbol processing machine that takes symbolic information as input, manipulates it according to a set of rules and outputs decisions, solutions, judgments and so on. Bodies don't matter, society doesn't matter.

It was based on a parlor game for swapping gender that says a man and a woman leave the room and the party goers have to figure out who's the man and who's the woman by sending questions back and forth on paper. And the man's job is to try to pretend to be the woman and the woman's job is to be herself. And he says, what if we took the same test and replaced the man by a computer and the woman by any person?

1. Francis Collins began to wonder if we had to grapple with the big unknown in order to better understand who we are as human beings.
2. He went to medical school and found that atheism wasn't feeling very settled when he was sitting at the bedside of patients who were dying from diseases that we didn't have much to offer.
3. He began a twoyear journey to try to understand why people believe in God. Ultimately, he began to realize that the impoverishness he felt from considering human beings solely as mechanical entities was appealing to him, and that the idea of something outside of that that fits into things like love and beauty, altruism and goodness and morality was appealing.

> I went to medical school and I found my atheism wasn't feeling like it settled very well when I was sitting at the bedside of good honorable North Carolina people who were dying of diseases that we didn't have much to offer. And I wondered how I would handle that and figured for some of these people, clearly their faith was a source of great comfort. So I began a two-year journey to try to understand why did people believe in God. Ultimately, I began to realize the impoverishness that I felt from considering human beings solely as mechanical entities and the appeal of the notion that there was something outside of that that fits into things like love and beauty, altruism and goodness and morality. Does our DNA tell us that that beautiful sunset was something to stop for just a moment and kind of be a little bit in awe? Does the way in which listening to Beethoven's Third Symphony bring me to tears? Is that written in my DNA? What is that about?

> Math is a system of symbolic logic. It is not the indefinable thing that makes us human. And when you are building a computer program, it'll work if you do it this way and then it won't work if you do it the other way. But that's not how culture operates. That's not how relationships work. So there's a really a fundamental difference between what we can do with computers and what we can do in society. Because when it comes right down to it, computers are machines that do math. They compute. And we forget that when we get grandiose about artificial intelligence and we get grandiose about our imaginings.
