### ✨ Key takeaways
1. There is always an adaptation process when it comes to new technologies, as people need to collectively ask how they will be used.
2. It is important to be aware of the ethical implications of new technologies, as they can have a big impact on society.

> Do you do you think that you would want to like put in limitations into your software to You know, not a lot of certain things you think this is about to change the way we view Videos as this technology gets more standardized and available to everyone For sure.
>
> **Speaker 1**
> Um, yeah, I think as every major technology will break through There's always like social concerns about how it might be misused or using not the right or intended ways And it's it's a good exercise to look at like history to see what has happened before This is really good like youtube video about photoshop when it was first released. I would think about it like the early 90s Um and they were like it's a it's kind of like a late night show and they're discussing like the ethical implications of manipulating Images in in magazines and they're like should should we allow to manipulate images and put them in magazines? And it like half of the panel was like no, we shouldn't just like it It breaks the essence of what photography is right And like 20 years after that it's like it makes no sense to think about not you doing something like that, right? And so there's also there's always like an adaptation process I would say Where people need to and we need to collectively ask like hey, how is it gonna be used?

### ✨ Key takeaways
1. Every major technology has its own set of social concerns, which are always adapted to as the technology evolves.
2. The early days of photography were filled with ethical debates about whether or not to manipulate images, but 20 years later this has become a normal part of the photography process.

But I think ultimately You understand what the limitations are and you also fine-tune your eyes and your Understanding of the world to make sense of that thing, right? And now everyone knows that photoshopped is a verb that you can use to describe something that's manipulated, right? Um and you do that same exercise and you go biking time and you see the same When film just started to appear it was this story interesting story about One of the first films that were made is like a train arriving to a station And they were like projecting that on a room and when people saw the train coming to a station everyone run away because like They felt it was coming
