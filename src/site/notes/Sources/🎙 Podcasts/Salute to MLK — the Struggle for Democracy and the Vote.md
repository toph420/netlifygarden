> But I want to trouble even the language of calling this experiment democratic. And I think that this is one of the most anti democratic bodies in the world, two senators from Nebraska and two from California. And there is no more anti democratic reality than the electoral college, which is a compromise to keep slavery in place there people who are understanding this is where the hope is that that entire regime is designed to keep people away from the power they deserve to eliminate and to destroy one person one vote. And there are people who are fighting for true democracy and local levels and across the world and we need to be very clear that we've had presidents who lost the popular vote who have been destructive. The wisdom of the American people would have kept us out of the Iraq war. The wisdom of the American people would have saved us from January 6. But there are mechanisms in place that are anti democratic that we call democratic and what I am hopeful about is there are people who have stopped calling kittens biscuits.
