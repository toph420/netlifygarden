Professor Luciano Floridi of the Oxford Internet Institute / Oxford University believes that this divide not only affects our understanding of the implications of this new age, but also the organization of a fair society. <br/>> <br/>>  The Information Revolution has been transforming the global economy, with the majority of global GDP now relying on intangible goods, such as information-related services. This in turn has led to the generation of immense amounts of data, more than humanity has ever seen in its history. With 95% of this data being generated by the current generation, Professor Floridi believes that we are becoming overwhelmed by this data, and that our agency as humans is being eroded as a result. <br/>> <br/>>  According to Professor Floridi, the digital divide has caused a lack of balance between technological growth and our understanding of this growth. He believes that the infosphere is becoming polluted and the manifold of the infosphere is increasingly determined by technology and AI. Identifying, anticipating and resolving these problems has become essential, and Professor Floridi has dedicated his research to the Philosophy of Information, Philosophy of Technology and Digital Ethics. <br/>> <br/>>  We must equip ourselves with a viable philosophy of information to help us better understand and address the risks of this new information age. Professor Floridi is leading the charge, and his research on Digital Ethics, the Philosophy of Information and the Philosophy of Technology is helping us to better anticipate, identify and resolve problems caused by the digital divide.<br/>> <br/>>  TOC:<br/>> <br/>>  [00:00:00] Introduction to Luciano and his ideas<br/>> <br/>>  [00:14:00] Chat GPT / language models<br/>> <br/>>  [00:28:45] AI risk / "Singularitarians" <br/>> <br/>>  [00:37:15] Forms of governance<br/>> <br/>>  [00:43:56] Re-ontologising the world<br/>> <br/>>  [00:55:56] It from bit and Computationalism and philosophy without purpose<br/>> <br/>>  [01:03:05] Getting into Digital Ethics<br/>> <br/>>   <br/>> <br/>>  Interviewer: Dr. Tim Scarfe<br/>> <br/>>   <br/>> <br/>>  References:<br/>> <br/>>  GPT‚Äê3: Its Nature, Scope, Limits, and Consequences [Floridi]<br/>> <br/>>  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3827044<br/>> <br/>>   <br/>> <br/>>  Ultraintelligent Machines, Singularity, and Other Sci-fi Distractions about AI [Floridi]<br/>> <br/>>  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4222347<br/>> <br/>>   <br/>> <br/>>  The Philosophy of Information [Floridi]<br/>> <br/>>  https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Information-Luciano-Floridi/dp/0199232393<br/>> <br/>>   <br/>> <br/>>  Information: A Very Short Introduction [Floridi]<br/>> <br/>>  https://www.amazon.co.uk/Information-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/0199551375<br/>> <br/>>   <br/>> <br/>>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Floridi<br/>> <br/>>  https://www.philosophyofinformation.net/

### [05:53] AI and Engineering: A Comparison

#### ‚ú® Summary
AI is at year zero as a branch of colony science. We do not have the intelligence, as I said, of a rat. When it comes to engineering, that looks like magic. But how do you know it's not the same process? Well, imagine you have two, two, four. And I tell you, one is plus, the other one is multiplication. Which one did I use to get four from two and two? I don't know. Two plus two is before, two by two is four. You see, you can't say. So is the same thing. No, it isn't. The way I do the dishes, the way my dishwasher did

> Now, remember, AI, is it an engineering branch or is a branch of colony science? Well, as a branch of colony science, we are at year zero. No step forward. We do not have the intelligence, as I said, of a rat. When it comes to engineering, that looks like magic. That looks like what has happened to humanity, who has given us so much brain to do what we're doing today. And the old phrase like, is it worth asking whether a submarine can swim? Really? Can I computer think? That's the wrong question. That's not the framework within which we should understand what a computer does. A submarine does what he does, an airplane does what he does, and it doesn't do it like a bird, doesn't do it like a fish. But it does it successfully. And that's the whole engineering point here. Success in delivering the output, given that particular input. But how do you know it's not the same process? Well, imagine you have two, two, four. And I tell you, one is plus, the other one is multiplication. Which one did I use to get four from two and two? I don't know. Two plus two is before, two by two is four. You see, you can't say. So is the same thing. No, it isn't. The way I do the dishes, the way my dishwasher did the dishes, two different things.

We started understanding ourselves in roughly two ways, who I am and what I can do. We are all data subjects here GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation says so. So if you have data subject and there's a gazillions of data about you somewhere being manipulated, well certainly your identity is not shall we say in question. The other half is remember not who I am but what I can doing as opposed to anyone else. And we define ourselves at least since count onwards, we manner count the German philosophy in terms of autonomy. We are special because we are in control of our actions. We can decide we can plan we can choose.

I am, no humanity speaking, different, exceptional, special because of my nature and because and or what I can do compared to anything else. So one is called personal identity. It's going to come close to privacy and the gazillions of data out there are eroding or transforming, exercising pressure on their particular who I am, my nature, my data subject as we are defined by the European legislation. We all data subjects here GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation says so.

I'm one of the few people, I hope many more than it seems, who agree with the Chinese room and the philosophy behind it. John got it right a long time ago with dealing with synthetic engines.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I am concerned about it. I'm one of the few people, I hope many more than it seems, who agree with the Chinese room and the philosophy behind it. Of course, you can always, among philosophers, argue for details and sophisticated counter-agricters. But the bottom line, John got it right a long time ago with dealing with synthetic engines. There is no understanding. There is no insight. There is no emotion involved, etc. Anything that we would go into qualifying, characterizing human intelligence, which is also a rather fuzzy concept, by the way. So on that front, I think we're going to see more and more of successful machines of the kind that we were just discussing. You mentioned the source, because that is the real difference. Let me give you a small example. Suppose you take from the shelf an amazing novel, a novel that has John Wanda Nobel, for example. I would be surprised if you were to confuse that for something that's been generated by GPT-X. The other thing is not true. Suppose you take a normal text like an encyclopedia entry or a good summary of that novel. Would you be able to tell me whether it's a human being or GPT-X? It wouldn't. So there's also a symmetry between the sort of product that we get and the sort of inferences that we can run. Final point. Technique is not everything. We always fall into the same trap.</blockquote>

Given the pollution of the InfoSphere with data generated from large language models, what are the ethical implications on society? There are quite enormous responsibilities on so many fronts.

There's responsibility, of course, of the source of this pollution. And by the way, we know that the actual sources are not many. It's not that each of us is constantly pouring, sort of providing extra bits of misleading information in life. We do inadvertently repeat and reverberate that. But the actual sources of, say, for example, Russian propaganda are very few and well-known, and likewise, in all, many other contexts. So first of all, a huge responsibility on those who are polluting the environment. There are few, they're powerful, and they should be coz-hailed, shall we say, if not entirely stopped. Huge responsibility on people who could legislate much better and more firmly.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Oh, no, I would like saying, well, I mean, you could read that in terms of the engine and wonder whether the engine and the old industrial revolution and urbanization coming, say, from model engine and so on. It has been liberating, has been enslaving, has been a good thing, a better thing. As all real historical and real philosophical issues, it's a mixed back and you can't simply say, oh, I wish the car had never been invented. Really, like, I'm not quite sure. But on the other hand, the damage that we have caused to this environment. So same with the AI. Now, one could say, I wish people had never taken this genie out of the particular bottle. Really, like, the kind of things that we can do thanks to this. Now, it thinks of one case, for just a simple case, like called fusion. I mean, today, if there's even a remote chance to get there is because of machine learning, we will never get there without the enormous abilities of computational problem solving provided by AI and so forth. So this case, too, requires more commitment, more human intelligence, more governance, not less. So sometimes I find that debate becomes a little bit of a deterministic kind of debate between things that not people who think we're doomed and things are, you know, with now, Rosie Glass is thinking, oh, it's going to be a wonderful world. Well, honestly, it just happened to us. The crude, painful sort of truth is that unless we do something about it, it will be a mess.</blockquote>

The governance that we could develop would inevitably leverage this digital revolution by offering more participation at the beginning of the decision or process. Take a referendum, a painful memory here behind the UK, a referendum is not the right democracy. Why? Because you can't choose between, no, A and B,. If you dislike both A and B, someone has prepared the alternative for you. So, these are two distinctions that go against direct democracy. I'm saying offering so cannot be expected or compulsory, but plenty of offer at the beginning, not at the end.

The real democracy that is co-designing of the choices, not the options at the end, but the initial choices, is the one that says, should we consider a referendum or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So, the point here is that the earlier the involvement, the better is to live in that kind of society.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Is the universe a computational gigantic? Yes or no, meaningless. Is it worth modeling the universe as a gigantic for the purpose of making sense of our digital life? Oh, yes, definitely, because we are informational organisms. No, I meant in the 21st century, the best way of understanding human beings today is as information organisms.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Let me correct a joke for the philosophers who might be listening to this. Does he or she is? Is he the same or is not the same? Who is asking? Why? Because if it is the tax man, the tax man, you're doomed man. I mean, there is no way you can play any or I change every plan that you're going to pay that tax. It's the same ship. I don't care. But if it is a collector, that ship is worth zero. You change all the planks, you must be joking. It's worthless. So is it or is it not the same? Depends on why you are asking that particular question. Tell me why and I can give you the answer. No, why? In other words, no frame within which we have chosen the interface that provides the model of the system, not potential answer. So the question is like, is the universe a computational gigantic? Yes or no, meaningless. Is it worth modeling the universe as a gigantic for the purpose of making sense of our digital life? Oh, yes, definitely, because we are informational organisms. Aha. So metaphysics. No, I meant in the 21st century, the best way of understanding human beings today is as information organisms.</blockquote>
