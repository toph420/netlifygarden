## Notes

> Hey! I'm using Obsidian to plan/research for a book too!

> I have tonnes of notes for locations, characters, writing tips, etc.

> I also have a bunch of 'scene ideas' notes, and a bunch of 'plot ideas' notes. So if I have an idea of a plot point that involves Mother and Tom assaulting a castle, I would make a note titled [[Mother and Tom assault a castle\|Mother and Tom assault a castle]]. I will tag it `#writing #plot #ideas #tom #mother #castle #attack`

> Then when it comes to writing Tom's plot arc, I just need to search for `#tom AND #plot`, and all the plot ideas I have for Tom will show up for me to compile.

> I don't have much backstory yet, because my main characters are all young, and I begin the book right when noteworthy things start happening, so there's not much backstory there, really.

> But if I did have an idea for backstory which involves two characters, there are two things I would consider.

> 1.	⁠Use the same sort of 'atomic note' technique that I use for plot ideas and scene ideas, and break things down into single ideas. Suppose as part of the backstory, Tom and Mother had a fight, and Tom left home for the big city, which is where he is when the story begins. I would create a note called [[Tom and Mother fight\|Tom and Mother fight]]. I would tag it  `#writing #backstory #ideas #tom #mother #fight`. Then I would transclude this note into both Tom and Mother's character notes. That way, when I edit the [[Tom and Mother fight\|Tom and Mother fight]] note, it will automatically update in the Tom and Mother character notes.
> 2.	⁠Or I would write out the backstory event/plot point in Tom's character note, because he is the more prominent character. I would put it under a heading ### Tom and Mother Fight. Then I would transclude that heading over to the Mother character note. So when I edit the event in my [[Tom\|Tom]] note, it updates automatically in the [[Mother\|Mother]] note.

> As a side note, I personally would get rid of your data dump page and copy each idea over to its own note. Then each idea can be tagged and/or sorted into a folder (or arranged under MOCs if that's what you use). This way you can more easily transclude these ideas into other notes, or search for them using specific tags etc. I feel like dumping a whole bunch of ideas into one data dump page is really defeating the whole point of Obsidian, which is ease of linking ideas, using tags and wikilinks.

> Let me know if there are things I have said that don't make sense, or if you have any other questions!
