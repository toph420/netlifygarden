# Story about humans and fame

> What is the desire for humans to want to be famous, to have center stage? And what's it like to be famous when you don't want necessarily want or ask for the fame?

This idea came about while listening to this episode of [[Podcast - This American Life\|Podcast - This American Life]]: [Human Spectacle](https://pca.st/episode/fdefb4a1-28f1-46a4-855e-9c52dd59f61c) about when people are on display, not by choice.
