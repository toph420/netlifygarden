# Blog post about Committing

> About commitment 

- committing is a vicious cycle
- You get looped into one thing for long periods of time like say a video or even an effect on a particular shot, but then you battle with whether or not to commit because inevitably youâ€™ll lose out on time you could spend doing other stuff.
