# Scene Ideas

> Running list of scene ideas

- A couple walks into the kitchen in the morning to make coffee and both have their phones on, one on NPR, one on NY Times, an argument ensues
- A couple discussing how much mio they each squirt into the water by using sound effects that sound like mio sound. “Kshhhhh Ksh Kshh”
- “I’m not gonna lie I had one too many white claws and hit my head on my desk trying to pick up my cat.”
- Dude raps about only be with supermodels, cut to his living room with a bunch of models after the club, but the models are all pointing laughing cuz dude is passed out with a cig in his hand.
