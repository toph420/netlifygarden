# Locus Solus

> The wild story of the suicide of an ashamed father and son after the murder of a beloved girl

See Ch. 4, Scene 8 of [[Sources/📚 Books/Locus Solus#The Suicide of François-Charles Cortier\|Locus Solus#The Suicide of François-Charles Cortier]] for the full story.

I want to recreate this story in modern times

Outline-ish:
1. Dad, a widow, father of two, son and daughter
2. Dads young daughter is killed while decorating one of his skulls, burned alive, dad tries but can't save her
3. Dads best friend dies and leaves a daughter, a girl which Dad sees as a sign, a link to, a reincarnation of his dead daughter
4. Dad takes the girl in and considers her his own daughter, and him father
5. Dad falls in love with the girl as she ages and plans to propose
6. Dad goes to propose and the girl mistakes his proposal at first for his blessing to marry his son
7. Dad is fuming with rage and jealousy and decides to try again, this time forcefully
8. She denies him, saying she only wants his son
9. Dad kills and violates her
10. Dad blames it on the servant, and the son is devastated
11. Years go by and dad is tormented with guilt but cannot bare to face the law, nor to tarnish his sons future
12. Dad decides to kill himself, but first leaves breadcrumbs to a confession which may or may not be found
13. The son finds the confession, and upon doing so decides he cannot be go on, disgraced
14. The son leaves a confession of his intentions to hide the original confession and kills himself, finding comfort in the fact that this confession may or may not be found
15. The servants mother employs the reanimator to determine what happened in that room the night of the suicide, leading to the discovery of the confessions and the release of her son from jail

Fuck that's awesome. The details of the discovery of the confession are interesting, but these could be an entirely unique mechanism.
