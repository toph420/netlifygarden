# Criminal Elections

> A story about a world where criminals are also elected to maintain balance among the elite and the working class, a Robin Hood type scenario. But the elites try to infiltrate the criminal world, perhaps realizing the elite are actually the real criminals. Potential consumerism, capitalist satire.
