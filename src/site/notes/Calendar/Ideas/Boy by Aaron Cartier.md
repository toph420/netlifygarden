# Boy by Aaron Cartier

## Idea Summary

So here's a quick synopsis. I imagine this being a pretty experimental video, not as in effects, but the story will jump from present day to memories and back, possibly showing different outcomes simultaneously.

Basically, just like the song says, a girl goes away for the weekend, when she comes back the boyfriend realizes that something has changed. He can tell she met someone/did something but she cant bring herself to tell him.

Not sure what she does exactly while she's away, but i imagine a punk show at a dive bar, maybe the boy is in the band, maybe he works there.

**Scenario 1:**

The boyfriend finds the boy (either online or irl) and ruins his life by digging up some shit he did in the past, maybe he's semi-famous/influencer in some circles and the boyfriend causes him to get canceled, and the girl never tells the boyfriend what she did when she went away that weekend, but the boyfriend knows and empathizes with her, knowing that the boy is toxic he lets it slide, and more than likely she knows deep down that the boyfriend knows.

**Scenario 2:**

When she gets home things go on for a few months but they are both tormented by what happened (not sure if she tells him or if he found out). As much as they love each other they can't seem to shake the memory. Eventually things fall apart in a bad way. The girlfriend sees the boy in her own town 6 months later, the same feeling is there, they end up together.
