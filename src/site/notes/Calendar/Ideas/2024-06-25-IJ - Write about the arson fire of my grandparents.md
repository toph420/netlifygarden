# Write about the arson fire of my grandparents

> I remember the details vividly, running through the woods with my dad, turning the corner and seeing a massive blaze, stopped in my tracks and took my breath away. We later found out it was arson and it was the first of a few more houses to burn that year.

I could do something a Lovecraftian here, perhaps the cottages were a part of some cult commune (basically are), and the locals sought revenge for infiltrating their land or people, for bringing spirits.
