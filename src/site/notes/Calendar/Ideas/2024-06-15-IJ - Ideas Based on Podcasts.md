In the months since the spread of the coronavirus, stories of selfishness and exploitation have become all too familiar: people ignoring social distancing guidelines, or even selling medical equipment at inflated prices. Most of our public and economic policies take aim at these sorts of people ‚Äî the wrongdoers and the profiteers. But is there a hidden cost to the rest of us when we put bad actors at the center of our thinking? Do the measures we put in place to curtail the selfish inadvertently hurt our capacity to do right by others?

Machine learning language looks like galaxy, stars location depends on their relation to each other

Hipster - authenticity + conservative = electability according to machine language

The strange story of an unlikely crew of people who band together to take on one of the worlds' largest problems using nothing but whale sounds, machine learning, and a willingness to think outside the box. Even stranger, several of the world's most accomplished scientists seem to think they might have a good idea.

[https://www.startalkradio.net/show/cosmic-queries-oumuamua/](https://www.startalkradio.net/show/cosmic-queries-oumuamua/)

On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson, comic co-host Chuck Nice, and cosmochemist and author Dr. Natalie Starkey answer fan-submitted Cosmic Queries about ‚ÄòOumuamua, the first detected interstellar object that passed through the solar system.

To start, Chuck wonders why we even study space rocks if they‚Äôre all the ‚Äúsame.‚Äù Natalie tells us how studying space rocks helps us understand our solar system when studying Earth only tells us so much. You‚Äôll learn why asteroids might be the leftover building blocks from planets. We ponder what might be hiding in the Oort Cloud and why ‚ÄòOumuamua is basically an interstellar vagabond.

You‚Äôll find out more about ‚ÄòOumuamua‚Äôs discovery and how it got its name. We also talk about the only other interstellar object we‚Äôve documented (so far). What is the likelihood we will see another interstellar object? Natalie explains the difficult task of looking in the right place at the right time since interstellar objects can, literally, come from anywhere.

How do we differentiate an interstellar comet from a comet that came from the Oort Cloud? We explore the idea of panspermia. Could life survive such a perilous journey similar to ‚ÄòOumuamua‚Äôs? Lastly, Natalie helps us understand why ‚ÄòOumuamua‚Äôs shape is so peculiar. All that, plus, we ask the obvious question: was it sent by aliens?
