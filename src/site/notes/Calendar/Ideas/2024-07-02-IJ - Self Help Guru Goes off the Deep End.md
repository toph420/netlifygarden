# Self Help Guru Goes off the Deep End

> A story about a self help guy that ironically loses his cool at someone talking down to him, as if they are better than him, similar to how he talks to folks. He loses his shit and goes against every one of his tenets, killing a client, now asking for help from criminals on how to get away with murder. How the tables have turned.
