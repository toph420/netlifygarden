# Crazy Chair Lady and the Hot Guy

> A story about our neighbors

We saw our neighbor who we call "hot girl", bringing her chair out to the curb with her new boyfriend, he is not "hot guy", hot guy was the guy before hot girls new boyfriend. well, we always saw hot guy, he had a cute moustache, i kind of miss him. he did yoga sometimes in the yard and she would also do some sort of physical routine in the front yard. They, maybe just he, liked mountain biking or something cuz he had a cool helmet and a cool white bike that i envied.

Anyway, one day hot guy was gone and new guy was here (I suspect infidelity). He's a stoner, a deadhead, and not as hot as hot guy. Yesterday they were having a convo with the mailman (who's also a legend that deserves his own story) while double teaming a vintage loveseat down the porch stairs. Devon and I watched and, in true form as the recently crowned crazy-chair-lady, next thing i knew it i was carrying that mf into our living room.

It is grandma orange covered in partridges and pear trees. But i love it, and I love my crazy-chair-lady :)

Anyway, the mystery is: what's wrong with the chair? why were they getting rid of the chair? do they know we have the chair? should we ask them about the chair? what are they like? what are their names? what really happened to hot guy?
