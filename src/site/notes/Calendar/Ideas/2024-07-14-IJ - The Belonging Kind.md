# The Belonging Kind

> This short story, The Belonging Kind, about alienation and the desire to fit in and be wanted would be so cool to adapt into a short film

see [[Sources/📚 Books/Burning Chrome#⭐️ The Belonging Kind\|Burning Chrome#⭐️ The Belonging Kind]]

see [[Sources/📰 Articles/WFRs 101 Weird Writers - William Gibson and John Shirley - The Belonging Kind\|WFRs 101 Weird Writers - William Gibson and John Shirley - The Belonging Kind]] - interesting analysis 

Clearly this is a very visually stunning piece but could we adapt it for a shoestring budget and make this a 5minute short?
