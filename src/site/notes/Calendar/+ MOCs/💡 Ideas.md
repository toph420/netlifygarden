>  - [i] #💡 #on/writing [[+ Encounters/Ulysses Notes\|Ulysses Notes]] "That individual man’s day-by-day disappointments or successes are on a par with the large-scale disappointments  or successes of epic heroes or nations, is one of Joyce’s most telling  emphases. Joyce is not playing a clever little game when he parallels a  Stephen with a Hamlet, a Bloom with an Odysseus, or even a Bloom with  Christ; rather he is giving to human experience at the commonplace level  a weight and a universality which the greatest literature gives to it—and  which the religious dimension also gives to it."
