- #on/writingjournal Mi amor skates the surface between a life of drug use in perpetuity and the amateur free jazz trio asleep at the horn.
- #on/writingjournal Crawling. That's the only way to put it. The news of her chronic illness turned acute infection sent my skin into military mode.
- #on/writingjournal The calming effect of staring into her eyes, through the flames, the crowd, the darkness, allowed me the faculty to escape the shame, even if for a few soft seconds. An alarm shuttered and the ground jolted beneath, the digital red numbers on the floor indicator shuffled at random, scarring the moment with a hot coal of panic. Beer spilled and her friends giggled. Eyes peered in through the cracked door as the cramped cage plummeted. She wore a mascara that sucked up the night and a smile disconnected from her body.
- #on/writingjournal Deputy Fenton lobbed his precious donut at the store window when he saw who was peering through the opposite side of the glass. He made the split second decision, the type you learn from years of training and experience, to cock his weapon, aim the barrel down the hole where the donut stuck, smearing the pretty face like her makeup from the tears after he pulled the trigger. Glass shards littered the ground with different angles of the same scene, some covered in blood, some sprinkles.
- #on/writingjournal Becoming the top brass in any field is never easy, shit it's hardly possible. But I met a guy at the laundromat with three eyes, one of which leered at the sexy cash register chick while the other two sized me up, scoping out the size of my pockets for any chump change. It was easy to see he wasn't all there but i had half an hour to kill so we got to talking and soon enough we had a plan drawn up.  The plan wasn't important, the girl at the register was. Tilly Winters the ex model blacklisted for clawing the eyes out of a red carpet photographer related to some sleazy fashion industry head honcho.
- #on/writingjournal coalesce space between us, strattle it, harness the inseparable reproductive power to multiply, begrudge the tyranny of dolla dolla bills, slide into the speakeasy thru the secret hole in the puddle, bring a camera and some scratch offs, tonight's the night we fight to maintain celibacy, before we get fucked. brushed up against the bearded loose lipped tavern, refreshing for "notice of intent to evict (draft)", under it all it smells the same as the first time I smoked a Benjamin for views, daddy track marks would be jealous, belt the line about that war is bad, and roll up her goodbyes so it can run its course and black my lungs.

## Themes that Interest Me

- Control vs Chaos
- Fate, Determinism vs free will
- imperialism, colonialism, power
- Finding meaning
- Consciousness, a crutch? [[Sources/ðŸ“š Books/Blindsight\|Blindsight]]
- Cults
- Illuminati
- Witch trials 
- BDSM
- Addiction
- Drugs
- Capitalism, Greed, envy, money
- heaven, HELL
- theology
- Stuck as a cog in the machine, privilege of pursuing passion, even if living in squalor 
- things that happen while looking the other way (broken veil podcast, [[Sources/ðŸ“š Books/Blindsight\|Blindsight]])
- the idea that the world is entirely subjective experience, like a game board you're just moving the pieces around, including others and events around you, but something shatters the idea, not of free will or fate, but some grand plan at work
- the smallest difference has universal effects, the butterfly effect but comedic, political, philosophical  
- Gossip, eavesdropping, spying, lurking, voyeurism
- Body/language/silence/sex
- Note from Logic of Sense appendix: The object of desire is the Image/Elements, not the body/thing. Desiring Others is desiring the possible worlds they express. Perversion bypasses the body detour to desire elements/images directly ("conjunction of libido and elements").  [[Sources/ðŸ“œ Papers/The Logic of Sense#4. MICHEL TOURNIER AND THE WORLD WITHOUT OTHERS\|The Logic of Sense#4. MICHEL TOURNIER AND THE WORLD WITHOUT OTHERS]]
- Theatre of cruelty, Artaud, aware of the theatre, the limits, this body, idealism, representation, be a nomad
- Telepathy
- Snake venom [Lepht Hand w Machinic Unconscious Happy Hour](https://youtu.be/-x1XQ5dVM5Y?si=Gw9vG-nSafKTciDg)

Miscellaneous Stuff
- "they get on like a house on fire"
- ðŸ”¥Committee changes rules and has a hearing and secretly is conducting a seance via the new rules
- Fred Hampton
