Man I've got soooo many things I want to write about. Here's a quick list of a bunch of different stuff I want to share with you guys:

- Blog posts 
	- Miscellaneous ponderings, passing thoughts, political musings, all the stuff I want to get off my chest.
- [[Calendar/+ MOCs/💡 Ideas\|Ideas]]
	- I'm always coming up with ideas for stuff like stories, edits, effects, and I want to challenge myself to flesh them out a bit more by forcing myself to dig deeper and write about them, to share them.
- Reviews
	- I consume a lot of content, from [[Cards/700 - Art and Recreation/Movies and TV/📺 My TV Shows\|TV Shows]], [[Cards/700 - Art and Recreation/Movies and TV/🍿 My Movies\|Movies]], and [[Cards/700 - Art and Recreation/Podcasts/🎙 My Podcasts\|Podcasts]]. I want to share what I'm into and garner some inspiration for myself to build ideas and notes from. 
- Technical Stuff
	- Tutorials -- how I use stuff like [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Descript\|Descript]] and [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Davinci Resolve\|Davinci Resolve]]
	- How I do business, create proposals, track projects in [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]
- [[Cards/700 - Art and Recreation/🎨 Inspiration\|🎨 Inspiration]]
	- I want to share stuff that inspires me, like round ups of [[Cards/700 - Art and Recreation/Videos\|Videos]] and [[Cards/600 - Applied Sciences/Photography/Photography\|Photography]]
- Stories
	- In addition to all the non-fiction stuff I want to share some fiction writing.
	- Back in high school creative writing class we did a 10 minute "stream-of-consciousness" writing exercise. I always loved it and was surprised at the results. I want to start this again. 
	- Poetry, yep, I dig poetry.
