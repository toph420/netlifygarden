# ðŸŒœ Apocalyptic Summer Militia

**People**: [[Devon\|Devon]]

## Summary
> Apocalyptic saw blade shaped alien soldiers invade. My phone is dead and the city is on fire, guess I'll take the bus tour one last time.

## Dream

it was a busy night in the city, I was out with a friend getting some food. We stood outside of frosty boy ice cream. Hot summer day. Everyone looked up so I followed. First it was these helicopter looking things marked as police. The movements were erratic, inhuman. Like drones but defying physics, making abrupt turns and changes in altitude as if to mimic what a human plane would do. People began to panic and run to seek shelter in the restaurants. My friend ducked into a place ok the corner and I ran across the street where I had ordered food from, refusing to accept that anything wild was happening. My phone was low on battery so I asked the girl working if I could borrow a charger, at first she gave me a bit of a cold shoulder but recognizing the situation she called me back and took my phone. She traded me for some big sunglasses to identify me later and plugged it in. I looked out the window and ducked inside, the drone type things were still flying, causing panic and large silent shadows. Small militias of citizen, badass people with guns, in groups, gathered on porches of their houses and from apartment windows, ready to fire at anything deserving. It was silent, everyone contemplating the implications, awaiting chaos to break out. Suddenly a few militias began firing, I tried to look out the window and saw a group of gumen and women running down the street after something, firing. I couldn't get a good look at what they were firing at. I grabbed my phone and tried to decide whether to call Devon, not wanting to startle her and also not willing to believe this was it. Another gun battle broke out and this time I did get a close look. A matte black thin metal circular gear shaped, like a table saw blade with squared blades came rolling in, forget about physics, this thing was cruising, taking enemy fire like a boss. In the center of the disc there was what looked like a solar panel, a black rectangular panel with small lights. The militias took aim at this piece, the brain of the creature. The militias would not let up, it seems they had already downed another of these and knew what they were doing. It felt oddly comforting knowing they could be defeated, but then again, how many are there, there must be millions. Panic. I tried to call Devon but no answer, people began to move, now it's full panic, people wanting to get to their loved ones. I receive a text from Devon, a news article showing ships destroying cities, I laugh at the absurdity of it all and want to get home to her, I wonder if I should respond with something light like "crazy huh" to calm her worries, but it's no use. My phone is still dying, oh boy she's going to be so mad at me for not charging it before I left. I'm running down the street next to a couple of guys, I hear him say something like "they even did a u-turn for safe measure", commenting on the alien movements of the ships pretending to be human operated. I ask to borrow his phone and we reach a viewpoint of the city. It's being annihilated by all sorts of ships and those spinning discs. I begin to accept that this is the end. The guy I borrowed the phone from hops on a bus and i tell him I've still got his phone, he tells me to keep it and as the bus pulls away I'm standing inside of it, on the step of the doorway. The bus driver is giving a tour of the city and says something like "here's a new vegan ice cream shop, perfect for a hot summer day like today", going on like her duty is to maintain control and keep calm, all the while her face shows cracks of fear. I dial devon and she doesn't pick up at first, dial again, she picks up, she immediately begins reciting a line from a book, I can barely hear over the destruction, "came into this world a ... went out with a ...." I told her that I love her and will be home soon, I heard a groan and looked back at the city taking fire from every angle. The bus tour continued. 


## Analysis

This dream appears to be a vivid representation of anxiety and a loss of control in the face of overwhelming, chaotic events. The invasion scenario, with its inexplicable and physics-defying elements, strongly suggests a feeling of being unprepared and vulnerable to forces beyond your understanding or influence.

The initial mundane setting (getting food with a friend on a hot summer day) quickly devolves into panic, highlighting a sudden and disorienting shift from normalcy to crisis. The "erratic, inhuman" movements of the police-marked helicopters, which defy physics, could symbolize a breakdown of order and logic in your waking life, or a perception of authority figures acting in unpredictable or illogical ways.

Your struggle with your phone's low battery and your desire to connect with Devon underscore a deep need for connection and reassurance during a time of crisis, as well as a potential fear of being isolated or unable to communicate when it matters most. The concern about Devon being angry about the uncharged phone, even amidst an apocalypse, emphasizes the persistence of everyday anxieties even in extreme situations.

The emergence of "small militias of citizen, badass people with guns" offers a brief glimmer of hope and a sense of agency, suggesting a desire for competence and resilience in the face of adversity. However, this is quickly counteracted by the overwhelming number of alien threats, leading back to feelings of helplessness and despair. The "silent shadows" and the "silent" contemplation before chaos erupts indicate a pervasive sense of dread and the anticipation of inevitable disaster.

The recurring motif of the bus driver maintaining a mundane "tour" while the city is being annihilated strikingly illustrates a coping mechanism â€“ a desperate attempt to maintain normalcy and control in the face of absolute chaos. This could reflect a personal tendency to downplay or intellectualize frightening situations.

Finally, Devon's recitation of a line from a book, "came into this world a ... went out with a ....", and your declaration of love, suggest a profound acceptance of the dream's dire circumstances and a prioritization of emotional connection and farewells. It speaks to a raw acknowledgment of mortality and the importance of relationships when all else is crumbling.

Overall, the dream is a powerful exploration of fear, helplessness, the need for connection, and attempts to cope with overwhelming situations where external circumstances are beyond control.
