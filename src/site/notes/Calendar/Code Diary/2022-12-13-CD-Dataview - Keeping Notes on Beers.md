## Summary
> Track and display metadata with dataviewjs

## Code
> **Keeping notes on Beers**

> Final example iâ€™d like to showcase, is how I use dataviewjs for styling in my Beer notes.

> Iâ€™m an occasional beer drinker, love trying different ones, always forget which I like and where I got them. For ages I wanted to be able to have a personal way of keeping track of what I liked and disliked, but at the same time, have it quick to do, otherwise I wonâ€™t do it. After a bit of refining iâ€™ve settled on a note template that works well for me that looks something like this:

> Rating: 9
> ABV: 6.5%
> Cost: Â£
> Producer: Pressure Drop
> Type: Porter
> Bought-From: "[[Beer and Burger]]"
> Tasting-Notes: "Great porter, really balanced flavour, not to sweet and can taste the coffee and chocolate. Really easy drinker. Would definitely get again"

> N.B. If you look close youâ€™ll see a few minor inconsistencies in the code snippets across my showcases, since my templates and queries get a bit more evolved. Ultimately Obsidian is a tool for capturing knowledge for me so I try not to be too disciplined or care too much about the underlying consistency unless I have a reason too.
