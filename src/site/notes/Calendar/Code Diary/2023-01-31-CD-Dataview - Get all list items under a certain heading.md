## Summary
> Great discussion about querying specific parts of notes, ie list items under a certain heading 

## Code

> [!summary] Reddit Post
> Query and filter items under a heading

> I have many files with a reference heading in them, like this:

I'll often switch to a LIST instead of a TABLE if I'm grouping because it usually looks better. You have to drop theÂ `AS "References"`if you do that because there are no column headings in a list.

> GROUP BY file.name
> SORT key desc

> This is awesome! Thank you. Do you know why it doesn't create links to the files?

> You'd have to group by file.link - instead of just the file.name - but then it should give the links.
