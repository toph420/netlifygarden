# Save the Cat

> A [[+ Encounters/Storytelling\|Storytelling]] structure 15 beats

> [!ava]+ Cheat Sheet
> 
> The name comes from the idea that the hero should do something likeable early on - like saving a cat - to make the audience root for them.
> 
> Since Snyder’s sheet was originally created for screenwriting, the bracketed number by each beat is the page or pages that it would take up of a standard 110-page screenplay. The beats are as follows:
> 
> 1. **Opening Image [1]:** An opening snapshot.
> 2. **Theme Stated [5]:** We are introduced to the central theme or lesson of the story.
> 3. **Set Up [1-10]:** The hero and the 'ordinary world' are introduced.
> 4. **Catalyst [12]:** Something happens that sets the story in motion.
> 5. **Debate [12-25]:** The hero is hesitant to take action.
> 6. **Break Into Two [25]:** The hero takes up the challenge.
> 7. **B Story [30]:** The subplot kicks in, introducing a character who helps the hero in their transformation.
> 8. **Fun and Games [30-55]:** The hero in the throes of their challenge or journey.
> 9. **Midpoint [55]:** The stakes are raised.
> 10. **Bad Guys Close In [55-75]:** Things start going downhill for the hero.
> 11. **All is Lost [75]:** Things go from bad to worse. The hero hits rock bottom.
> 12. **Dark Night of the Soul [75-85]:** Faced with defeat, the hero must reckon with their loss and how they got there.
> 13. **Break Into Three [85]:** The hero realizes a truth that’s been evading them all this time.
> 14. **Finale [85-110]:** Putting their new awareness into action, the hero conquers the bad guys.
> 15. **Final Image [110]:** A snapshot that mirrors or contrasts the opening image. 
> 
> The writer should be able to describe each beat with just one or two sentences.

> This outline incorporates themes and elements common in Philip K. Dick's work, such as questioning reality and identity, without directly copying any specific story. It demonstrates how the Save the Cat structure can be applied to a science fiction narrative exploring philosophical questions about the nature of self and memory.
