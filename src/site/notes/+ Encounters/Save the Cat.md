# Save the Cat

> A storytelling structure, 15 beats 


> [!NOTE]+ Cheat Sheet
> ## The 15 steps of Save the Cat
> 
> Since Snyder’s sheet was originally created for screenwriting, the bracketed number by each beat is the page or pages that it would take up of a standard 110-page screenplay. The beats are as follows:
> 
> 1. **Opening Image [1]:** An opening snapshot.
> 2. **Theme Stated [5]:** We are introduced to the central theme or lesson of the story.
> 3. **Set Up [1-10]:** The hero and the 'ordinary world' are introduced.
> 4. **Catalyst [12]:** Something happens that sets the story in motion.
> 5. **Debate [12-25]:** The hero is hesitant to take action.
> 6. **Break Into Two [25]:** The hero takes up the challenge.
> 7. **B Story [30]:** The subplot kicks in, introducing a character who helps the hero in their transformation.
> 8. **Fun and Games [30-55]:** The hero in the throes of their challenge or journey.
> 9. **Midpoint [55]:** The stakes are raised.
> 10. **Bad Guys Close In [55-75]:** Things start going downhill for the hero.
> 11. **All is Lost [75]:** Things go from bad to worse. The hero hits rock bottom.
> 12. **Dark Night of the Soul [75-85]:** Faced with defeat, the hero must reckon with their loss and how they got there.
> 13. **Break Into Three [85]:** The hero realizes a truth that’s been evading them all this time.
> 14. **Finale [85-110]:** Putting their new awareness into action, the hero conquers the bad guys.
> 15. **Final Image [110]:** A snapshot that mirrors or contrasts the opening image. 
> 
> The writer should be able to describe each beat with just one or two sentences.
