> [!ava] Cybersyn Project Summary
> The Cybersyn Project was a unique experiment in economic management and innovation implanted by the Chilean government under President Salvador Allende between 1971 and 1973. The project aimed to use cutting-edge technology of the time, including early computers and telex machines, to manage and control the national economy. It was designed by British cyberneticist Stafford Beer who intended to create a real-time control system for the economy, allowing for quick response to economic issues. The project ended with the military coup in 1973, which resulted in Allende’s ousting. Despite its short lifespan, the Cybersyn Project is considered an ambitious attempt at using technology for large-scale economic coordination.
