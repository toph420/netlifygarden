## Anarchist Fiction

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Cory Doctorow, specifically Walkaway and maybe The Lost Cause or the Martin Hench books as well.  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The rest of the Black Dawn series of speculative fiction from AK Press. Margaret Killjoy wrote one, but it also has titles from adrienne marie brown, Aric McBray, and SJ Klapecki  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The Illuminatus! trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†if you can find it, a copy of Garbage World by Charles Platt would be fun  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†everyone loves to talk about The Dispossessed, but I personally prefer The Telling and think it's more particularly relevant just now.  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The Mysteries of New Venice by Jean-Christophe Valtat. The first one is Aurourarama

‚Ä¢	‚Å†any of the solarpunk anthologies, Ecopunk!, the Solarpunk Summers and Solarpunk Winters duology, hell even Wings of Renewal: A Solarpunk Dragon Anthology. I'd be tickled to find any of them on an actual shelf somewhere.  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The Deluge by Stephen Markley  
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents by Octavia Butler. I know you said no graphic novels, but Sower does have a gorgeous graphic novel version also.
