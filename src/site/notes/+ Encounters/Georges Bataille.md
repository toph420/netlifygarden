# Georges Bataille

> Georges Bataille was a French intellectual whose work spanned philosophy, literature, and sociology, exploring themes of transgression, eroticism, and the nature of sovereignty. He challenged traditional philosophical and social structures, often focusing on the accursed share â€“ the excess energy and expenditure that cannot be contained within normal economic or social systems.
