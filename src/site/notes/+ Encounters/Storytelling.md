> Remember, these structures are guidelines, not rigid rules. As you practice with these exercises, you'll develop an intuitive sense of story flow and pacing. You may even find yourself creating your own unique structural approaches. The key is to understand these structures well enough to use them as tools, bending and adapting them to serve your story's needs.

## Tropes

> [!ava]- Bizarro/Surreal, Horror/Lovecratian, Sci-Fi Tropes  
> Bizarro and Surreal Tropes:
> 
> 1. Body transformation/mutation Description: Characters undergo bizarre physical changes. Example: A man's fingers turn into miniature versions of himself. Subtext: Identity crisis, body dysmorphia, societal pressure to conform.
> 2. Sentient inanimate objects Description: Everyday items gain consciousness and agency. Example: A toaster falls in love with a refrigerator and plots to eliminate other appliances. Subtext: Consumerism, objectification, the hidden lives of the overlooked.
> 3. Absurd social norms Description: Society follows illogical or extreme rules and customs. Example: In a world where walking is illegal, people move by elaborate somersaults. Subtext: Critique of arbitrary social conventions, conformity vs. individuality.
> 4. Reality warping/bending Description: The fabric of reality becomes malleable or inconsistent. Example: A character's emotions physically reshape their environment. Subtext: Subjective perception, mental health, the nature of reality itself.
> 5. Metaphors becoming literal Description: Figurative language manifests in literal, physical ways. Example: A broken-hearted person's chest actually cracks open, revealing a damaged organ. Subtext: The power of language, emotional impact of experiences.
> 
> Sci-Fi Tropes:

> 5. Posthuman evolution Description: Humans evolving beyond current physical and mental limitations. Example: Humans develop the ability to photosynthesize, eliminating the need for food. Subtext: The future of humanity, the ethics of enhancement, what it means to be human.
> 
> Horror/Lovecraftian Tropes:
> 
> 1. Cosmic indifference Description: The universe is vast, uncaring, and humans are insignificant. Example: Astronomers discover that Earth is a particle of dust on a cosmic being's shoe. Subtext: Existential dread, humanity's place in the universe, the search for meaning.
> 2. Incomprehensible entities Description: Beings so alien that human minds can't process their existence. Example: A creature whose very appearance drives viewers insane. Subtext: Limits of human understanding, fear of the unknown.
> 3. Unreliable perception of reality Description: Characters can't trust their own senses or memories. Example: A person realizes their entire life has been a hallucination induced by an eldritch being. Subtext: Nature of reality, trust in one's own mind, shared vs. individual experience.
> 4. Forbidden knowledge Description: Information so dangerous or traumatic that knowing it is harmful. Example: A book that, when read, erases the reader from existence. Subtext: Limits of human knowledge, curiosity vs. safety, power of information.
> 5. Psychological breakdown Description: Characters' minds fragment under stress or revelation. Example: A detective solving an impossible case gradually loses grip on reality. Subtext: Mental health, cognitive dissonance, the fragility of sanity.
