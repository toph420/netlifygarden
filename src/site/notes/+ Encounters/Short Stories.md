	- This is a terrifying, torturous revenge story. A story about an AI that was invented by humans to fight world war 3 but became more powerful and exacted revenge on humans for making it not quite sentient. The computer takes 5 humans prisoner, as his play toys and tortures them, but keeps them alive until one of them kills the others, leaving him alone, immortal, but a hero for saving the others through death. This shit is vivid and nightmarish, sheesh!
