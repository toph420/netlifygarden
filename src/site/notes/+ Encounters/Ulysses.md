## Proteus

- [UlyssesGuide.com — 3. Proteus Guide](https://www.ulyssesguide.com/3-proteus)
	- adjectives shape-shift into verbs.
	- In “Proteus,” **Stephen constantly changes his focus and his attitude, shifting between intellectual playfulness and bitter despair, modulating between contemplation, imagination, and memory.**  As he varies his mentality, his inner monologue adopts different styles, syntactical rhythms, and prosody.
	- Joyce in The Day of the Rabblement - "the artist, though he may employ the crowd, is very careful to isolate himself."
	- Stephen's dream: *After he woke me last night same dream or was it?  Wait.  Open hallway.  Street of harlots.  Remember.  Haroun al Raschid.  I am almosting it.  That man led me, spoke.  I was not afraid.  The melon he had he held against my face.  Smiled: creamfruit smell.  That was the rule, said.  In.  Come.  Red carpet spread.  You will see who. (3.365-69)
	- “Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me” (3.434-36).  This passage might be Stephen expressing his **vulnerability, loneliness, and deep desire for companionship and love** (the “word known to all men”), or these lines may be part of the poem he is drafting.
	- As he tongues his rotting teeth, we might note the episode’s motif of **decay**, involving his family, the dog carcass, the imagined corpse of the drowned man, and his ambitions.
	-  He leaves the booger on a rock, then has a moment of self-consciousness and peeks over his shoulder to see if anyone saw.  Richard Ellmann suggests that this backward glance exposes the absurdity of Stephen’s toying with subjectivism earlier in the episode and “implies that **art is not self-isolation, that it depends upon recognition of other existences**” (Ellmann 26).
