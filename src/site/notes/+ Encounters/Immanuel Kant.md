# Immanuel Kant

> Immanuel Kant argued that true knowledge comes from a synthesis of sensory experience and the mind's innate structures, rather than solely from reason or experience. In ethics, he proposed that morality is based on universal, rational duties, encapsulated in his categorical imperative, which dictates that one should act only according to principles that could be willed as universal laws for all rational beings.
