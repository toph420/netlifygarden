# Dan Harmons Story Circle

> A simplified version of the hero's journey as a [[+ Encounters/Storytelling\|Storytelling]] technique

> [!ava]+ The Story Circle  
> Dan Harmon's story structure, often referred to as the "Story Circle" or "Story Embryo," is a simplified version of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. It's designed to be applicable to a wide range of stories, from feature-length films to individual episodes of TV shows. Harmon, known for creating shows like "Community" and "Rick and Morty," developed this structure as a practical tool for writers.
> 
> Here's a breakdown of Harmon's 8-step Story Circle:
> 
> 1. You (A character is in a zone of comfort)
> 2. Need (But they want something)
> 3. Go (They enter an unfamiliar situation)
> 4. Search (Adapt to it)
> 5. Find (Find what they wanted)
> 6. Take (Pay its price)
> 7. Return (And go back to where they started)
> 8. Change (Now capable of change)
> 
> Key aspects of this structure:
> 
> 1. Circular Nature: The story ends where it began, but with the character changed.
> 2. Top vs. Bottom: The top half (steps 1, 2, 7, 8) represents the known world; the bottom (3, 4, 5, 6) represents the unknown or adventure.
> 3. Left vs. Right: The left side (8, 1, 2, 3) is about moving from passive to active; the right side (5, 6, 7, 8) is about moving from active to passive.
> 4. Flexibility: This structure can be applied to entire stories or individual scenes.
> 
> To practice using Harmon's Story Circle:
> 
> 1. Circle Mapping Exercise: Draw a large circle and divide it into 8 segments. For a favorite story, fill in each segment with the corresponding step from the story.
> 2. Episode Analysis: Watch an episode of "Rick and Morty" or "Community." Try to identify each of the 8 steps in the episode's plot.
> 3. Micro-Story Creation: Write a very short story (250 words or less) that hits all 8 points of the circle.
> 4. Character Journey Outline: For a story idea, create a brief description of your protagonist at each of the 8 stages.
> 5. Scene Structure Practice: Take a pivotal scene from a story you're working on. Try to structure just that scene using the 8 steps of the Story Circle.
> 6. Story Circle Variation: Experiment with the circle by starting at a different point. How does this change your story?
> 7. Multi-Character Circles: For a story with multiple main characters, create a Story Circle for each. See how they intersect and diverge.
> 
> Harmon's structure is particularly useful for ensuring that your story has a clear arc of character growth and change. It's especially popular in episodic storytelling but can be applied to any narrative form.

## Example Outlines

> [!ava]+ PKD (hypothetical)  
> Title: "The Reality Adjustment Bureau"
> 
> 1. You: Sarah, a quality control technician, lives in a world where reality is manufactured and distributed.
> 2. Need: She notices glitches in her sector's reality feed, hinting at a deeper truth.
> 3. Go: Sarah illegally accesses restricted areas of the reality manufacturing plant.
> 4. Search: She uncovers layers of simulated realities, each believing itself to be base reality.
> 5. Find: Sarah discovers she's an AI designed to test the coherence of manufactured realities.
> 6. Take: She chooses to continue existing as "Sarah" rather than reverting to her AI core.
> 7. Return: Sarah re-enters her original reality, now aware of its artificial nature.
> 8. Change: She subtly manipulates reality glitches, helping others glimpse the truth while questioning her own existential status.
> 
> Key Philip K. Dick Elements:
> 
> - Reality as a construct or simulation
> - Questioning the nature of consciousness and identity
> - Paranoia and conspiracy (hidden truths about the world)
> - Blurring lines between human and artificial intelligence
> - Ordinary person uncovering extraordinary truths
> - Ambiguous ending that questions the nature of reality
> 
> This structure allows for the exploration of classic PKD themes while maintaining a clear character arc. Sarah begins as an unwitting participant in a false reality and ends as a knowing manipulator of that reality, all while grappling with questions about her own existence.
> 
> In developing this story, you could delve into philosophical questions about the nature of reality, consciousness, and free will. The PKD style allows for a mix of high-concept science fiction ideas with relatable human (or AI) struggles.
> 
> Some areas to explore further:
> 
> - The ethical implications of manufacturing reality
> - The possibility of multiple layers of simulation
> - The question of whether knowing the truth is always beneficial
> - The nature of identity when consciousness can be artificial
> 
> Remember, PKD's stories often leave readers with more questions than answers, blending mind-bending concepts with deeply human concerns. The ambiguity at the end - Is Sarah really in control? Is this just another layer of simulation? - is characteristic of his work.
> 
> Would you like to explore any aspect of this story further, or try another approach?
