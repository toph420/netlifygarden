| **Matter** | The fundamental, unformed, unorganized, non-stratified, or destratified body (Plane of Consistency/BwO) | - Raw potential, pure flux, chaotic soup of energies.<br>- Flows: constant transformation.<br>- Subatomic & submolecular particles, pure intensities, prevital & prephysical free singularities. | Precedes and is the raw material for **Content** and **Expression**. It's the ground from which all strata emerge. | Undifferentiated energy, pure chaos before organization, subatomic particles before forming atoms. |
| **Content** | Formed matters | - **Substance:** The *kind* of matter chosen (the "what it's made of").<br>- **Form:** The *order* in which chosen matters are arranged (the "how it's put together," structure, configuration). | Formed by the **First Articulation** of the **Double Articulation** process. It is what is being expressed by **Expression**. Has its own form and substance. | The specific chemical elements of a rock (substance), its crystalline structure (form).<br>The cellulose and lignin in wood (substance), its grain and shape (form). |
| **Expression** | Functional structures | - **Organization of their own specific form:** The internal logic and arrangement of the expressive element itself.<br>- **Substances insofar as they form compounds:** How the expressive element interacts with and binds other substances, creating new functions. | Formed by the **Second Articulation** of the **Double Articulation** process. It is what *articulates* or *determines* **Content**. Has its own form and substance. "To express is always to sing the glory of God." | Nucleic sequences (DNA) determining compounds/organism/functions of an organism.<br>The grammar and syntax of a language, enabling communication. |
| **Stratum** | A stable, organized layer of reality formed through the double articulation. | - Always has a dimension of **Expression** serving as a basis for relative invariance (a stable code/pattern).<br>- "Every stratum is a judgment of God." | Formed by the process of **Double Articulation** (which distributes Content and Expression). It is a coherent system where Content and Expression are interwoven. | A geological layer of rock, a biological organism, a social institution, a language. |
| **Double Articulation** | The core process by which strata are formed and maintained. | - **First Articulation:** Concerns **Content** (selection and arrangement of matters into substances and forms).<br>- **Second Articulation:** Concerns **Expression** (development of functional structures, establishing relative invariance). | Distributes **Content** and **Expression** within each **Stratum**, constituting their real distinction. Creates an **Isomorphism with Reciprocal Presupposition** between them. | The process by which a language evolves (e.g., words are formed - 1st articulation; grammar rules emerge - 2nd articulation). |
| **Isomorphism with Reciprocal Presupposition** | The relationship between Content and Expression. | - **Isomorphism:** They share a similar underlying structure or pattern.<br>- **Reciprocal Presupposition:** They depend on each other; one cannot exist without the other. There is *no correspondence or conformity*. | Describes the dynamic, interdependent relationship between **Content** and **Expression** within a **Stratum**. | The structure of a genetic code (expression) being isomorphic to the structure of the proteins it builds (content). |
