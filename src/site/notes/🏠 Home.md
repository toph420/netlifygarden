# Welcome to Topher's Notes

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage everything from projects, people, journaling, and general note taking. This here website is my own little [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a collection of notes from my Obsidian vault that I've made public. I’m inspired by many others who talk about the benefits of [learning in public](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public). The goal in publishing this is to encourage myself to take more and better notes. My brain is all over the place so it goes without saying this may be messy, but feel free to click around! 

Due to the nature of some of these notes not every link will be reachable, but I'll do my best to continue to share what I can! 

Below are some jumping off points:
- [[+ Encounters/Stuff to Look Into\|Stuff to Look Into]] - Increasingly massive list of stuff I need to look into 🫣
-  [[Calendar/+ MOCs/🖋 Writing Journal\|🖋 Writing Journal]] - to keep up with my writing journey. 
-  [[Atlas/📚 Books\|📚 Books]] - all the books I'm reading, have read, and want to read
-   [[Atlas/🧠 My Vault\|🧠 My Vault]] - behind the scenes of this [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault
-  [[Atlas/🗺 Maps\|🗺 Maps]], [[Atlas/👨🏻‍🌾 Greenhouse\|👨🏻‍🌾 Greenhouse]], [[Atlas/📚 Library\|📚 Library]], [[Atlas/📥 Sources\|📥 Sources]] to explore
