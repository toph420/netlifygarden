# Welcome to Topher's notes

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage everything from projects, people, journaling, and general note taking. This here website is my own little [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a collection of notes from my Obsidian vault that I've made public. I’m inspired by many others who talk about the benefits of [learning in public](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public). The goal in publishing this is to encourage myself to take more and better notes. My brain is all over the place so it goes without saying this may be messy, but feel free to click around! 

Due to the nature of some of these notes not every link will be reachable, but I'll do my best to continue to share what I can! 

Below are some jumping off points:

- Be sure to check out the [[Calendar/+ MOCs/🖋 Writing Journal\|🖋 Writing Journal]] to keep up with my writing journey. 
- See what books I'm reading at the [[Cards/800 - Literature/📗 Bookshelf\|📗 Bookshelf]]
- Learn some more about this [[Sources/Tools + Plugins/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault of notes, I call it [[Atlas/🧠 Sid\|🧠 Sid]] (homage to Sid from [The Incredible Toon Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6RD2s4TQAQ))
- Use [[Atlas/🗺 Maps\|🗺 Maps]], [[Atlas/👨🏻‍🌾 Greenhouse\|👨🏻‍🌾 Greenhouse]], [[Atlas/📚 Library\|📚 Library]], [[Atlas/📥 Sources\|📥 Sources]] to explore 
- Use the backlinks on each page to navigate to related notes

Elsewhere:
- Check out [Ducks Films](http://ducksfilms.com) to see my videography work and hire me
- Check out [TopherGroenink.com](http://tophergroenink.com) to see some of my older work
- You can find a bunch of cool things from around the web that I’ve saved, like videos, photos, art, funny stuff, etc. in my [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/topher) and [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/tophg) collections.
